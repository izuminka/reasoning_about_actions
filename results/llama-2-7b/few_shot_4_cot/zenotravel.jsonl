Plane1 flies from city1 to city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl0: This action reduces the fuel level of the plane from fl1 to fl0, so the answer is True.\n3. Plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl0 to fl1: This action increases the fuel level of the plane from fl0 to fl1, so the answer is True.\n4. Plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl2: This action increases the fuel level of the plane from fl1 to fl2, so the answer is True.\n5. Plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl2 to fl3: This action increases the fuel level of the plane from fl2 to fl3, so the answer is True.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effects of these actions on the positions of the people:\n\n1. Person5 is at city1: This person is not affected by the actions performed, so the answer is True.\n2. Person6 is at city2: This person is not affected by the actions performed, so the answer is True.\n3. Person7 is at city0: This person is affected by the actions performed, as they board the plane at city0. So, the answer is False.\n4. Person4 is at city0: This person is affected by the actions performed, as they board the plane at city0. So, the answer is False.\n5. Person1 is at city1: This person is not affected by the actions performed, so the answer is True.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given initial conditions and the actions performed, the answer to your question is:\n\n\"Given the initial condition, the following actions are performed: plane1 gets refueled at city1 with fuel level fl0 to fl1, plane1 flies from city1 to city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl0, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl0 to fl1, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl2 and plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl2 to fl3 to reach the current state. In this state, is it True or False that person6 is at city2?\"\n\nThe answer is False. Person6 is still at city2."}

To determine whether fuel level fl1 is next to fuel level fl0 in the current state, we need to analyze the information provided in the initial conditions and the actions performed.\n\nFrom the initial conditions, we know that fuel level fl1 is next to fuel level fl0. However, the actions performed involve plane1 getting refueled at city0 with fuel level fl0 to fl1, and then flying from city1 to city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl0. This means that fuel level fl1 is no longer next to fuel level fl0 after the first action.\n\nFurthermore, the actions also involve plane1 getting refueled at city0 with fuel level fl2 to fl3, which means that fuel level fl2 is next to fuel level fl1. Therefore, we can conclude that fuel level fl1 is not next to fuel level fl0 in the current state.\n\nSo, the answer to your question is True. Fuel level fl1 is not next to fuel level fl0 in the current state."}

Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level. Flying the aircraft from a city to a destination city causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft to the next level. Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down. Refueling the aircraft in a city is executable if the aircraft is in the city. It changes the current fuel level to its next level.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level fl1 is next to fuel level fl0, fuel level fl3 is next to fuel level fl2, fuel level fl5 is next to fuel level fl4, person1 is at city4, person5 is at city2, plane1 is at city3, fuel level fl4 is next to fuel level fl3, person2 is at city3, person3 is at city4, fuel level fl2 is next to fuel level fl1, person4 is at city2, person6 is at city0, plane1 has fuel level fl1 and fuel level fl6 is next to fuel level fl5\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: plane1 flies from city3 to city2 with fuel level fl1 to fl0, plane1 gets refueled at city2 with fuel level fl0 to fl1, plane1 gets refueled at city2 with fuel level fl1 to fl2, plane1 gets refueled at city2 with fuel level fl2 to fl3, plane1 gets refueled at city2 with fuel level fl3 to fl4, person5 boards plane1 at city2, person4 boards plane1 at city2, plane1 flies from city2 to city4 with fuel level fl4 to fl3, person3 boards plane1 at city4, person1 boards plane1 at city4, plane1 flies from city4 to city0 with fuel level fl3 to fl2, person6 boards plane1 at city0, person5 departs plane1 at city0, person3 departs plane1 at city0, plane1 flies from city0 to city3 with fuel level fl2 to fl1, person4 departs plane1 at city3, person2 boards plane1 at city3, person1 departs plane1 at city3 and plane1 flies from city3 to city2 with fuel level fl1 to fl0 to reach the current state.

is executable if the person and the aircraft are both present in the city. Boarding a person in the city causes the person to be in the aircraft and not present in the city. Debarking a person in a city is executable if the person is in the aircraft and the aircraft is present in the city. Debarking a person in the city causes the person to be present in the city and not present in the aircraft. Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level. Flying the aircraft from a city to a destination city causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft to the next level. Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down.

Plane1 is at city1, which means it's already present in city1.\n4. Fuel level fl4 is next to fuel level fl3, which means there is enough fuel to fly from city1 to city2.\n5. Person7 is at city0, which means the plane1 needs to fly from city1 to city0 to refuel.\n6. Fuel level fl6 is next to fuel level fl5, which means there is enough fuel to fly from city0 to city1.\n7. Person3 is at city1, which means the plane1 needs to fly from city0 to city1 to refuel.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is possible to execute the action of getting refueled at city1 with fuel level fl0 to fl1. Therefore, the answer is True."}

Based on the information provided, I must inform you that the action \"plane1 gets refueled at city1 with fuel level fl0 to fl1\" is not executable at step 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Fuel level fl0 is the current fuel level of the plane, and it is not next to fuel level fl1. Therefore, refueling the plane with fuel level fl0 to fl1 is not possible at step 1.\n2. The plane is currently at city1, which means it is not present in city0. Therefore, the action of refueling the plane at city0 is not possible.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things.

As per the question, ball6 was at room1 initially, but it was dropped in room3, so it is currently at room3.\n3. Robot1 is at room4: False. As per the question, robot1 moved from room4 to room5, so it is no longer at room4.\n4. Ball2 is at room1: False. As per the question, ball2 was at room2 initially, but it was picked up by robot1 in room4, so it is currently at room1.\n5. Ball4 is at room3: True. As per the question, ball4 was at room2 initially, but it was moved to room3.\n6. Robot1 is carrying ball1 with lgripper1: True. As per the question, robot1 picked up ball1 from room1 using lgripper1, so it is currently carrying it.\n7. Ball6 is at room1: False. As per the question, ball6 was at room1 initially, but it was dropped in room3.\n8. Ball7 is at room5: True. As per the question, ball7 was dropped in room5 by robot1.\n\nTherefore, out of the eight properties, four are True and four are False."}

Ball2 is at room4: False (since ball7 was picked from room4 with lgripper1 by robot1 and dropped in room5, ball2 is no longer at room4)\n2. Robot1 is at room2: False (since robot1 moved from room4 to room5, then from room5 to room1, and is currently at room2)\n3. Ball6 is at room1: True (since ball6 was initially at room1 and is still at room1 after all the actions)\n4. Ball7 is at room5: True (since ball7 was picked from room4 with lgripper1 by robot1 and dropped in room5, ball7 is still at room5)\n5. Ball4 is at room2: False (since ball4 was initially at room2, but was picked from room2 with lgripper1 by robot1 and dropped in room3)\n6. Ball1 is at room5: True (since ball1 was initially at room1, picked from room1 with lgripper1 by robot1, and dropped in room5)\n7. Rgripper1 of robot1 is free: True (since lgripper1 of robot1 is free after dropping ball1 in room5)\n8. Ball2 is at room2: False (since ball2 was initially at room4, but was picked from room4 with lgripper1 by robot1 and dropped in room5)\n9. Lgripper1 of robot1 is free: True (since lgripper1 of robot1 is free after dropping ball1 in room5)\n10.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1 and crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1 and crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1 and crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1 and crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0 and crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0 and crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0 and crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0 and crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0 to reach the current state.

Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0 and crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0 and crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1 and truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1 and truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1 and truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1 and truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1 and truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1 and truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1, truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2, hoist3 drops crate1 on pallet3 at distributor1, hoist1 drops crate2 on crate3 at depot1, hoist4 lifts crate4 from pallet4 at distributor2 and crate4 is loaded by hoist4 into truck0 at distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1, truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2, hoist3 drops crate1 on pallet3 at distributor1, hoist1 drops crate2 on crate3 at depot1, hoist4 lifts crate4 from pallet4 at distributor2 and crate4 is loaded by hoist4 into truck0 at distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1, truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2, hoist3 drops crate1 on pallet3 at distributor1, hoist1 drops crate2 on crate3 at depot1, hoist4 lifts crate4 from pallet4 at distributor2 and crate4 is loaded by hoist4 into truck0 at distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1, truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2, hoist3 drops crate1 on pallet3 at distributor1, hoist1 drops crate2 on crate3 at depot1, hoist4 lifts crate4 from pallet4 at distributor2 and crate4 is loaded by hoist4 into truck0 at distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate3 from crate1 at depot0, crate3 is loaded by hoist0 into truck1 at depot0, truck1 is driven from depot0 to depot1, crate2 is loaded by hoist1 into truck1 at depot1, crate3 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist1 drops crate3 on pallet1 at depot1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist1 from truck1 at depot1, hoist0 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot0, crate1 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0, crate0 is loaded by hoist0 into truck0 at depot0, truck0 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck0 at distributor1, truck0 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2, hoist3 drops crate1 on pallet3 at distributor1, hoist1 drops crate2 on crate3 at depot1, hoist4 lifts crate4 from pallet4 at distributor2 and crate4 is loaded by hoist4 into truck0 at distributor2 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist3 is available, crate3 is at depot0, truck0 is at depot0, crate1 is on crate0, crate4 is clear, pallet3 is at distributor1, hoist4 is available, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, crate2 is at depot1, hoist2 is at distributor0, hoist2 is available, pallet2 is at distributor0, pallet2 is clear, crate4 is at distributor2, crate3 is clear, crate2 is on pallet1, crate2 is clear, pallet4 is at distributor2, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate1, hoist4 is at distributor2, crate1 is at depot0, hoist3 is at distributor1, truck1 is at depot0, crate0 is on pallet0, hoist1 is available, crate4 is on pallet4 and hoist1 is at depot1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck.

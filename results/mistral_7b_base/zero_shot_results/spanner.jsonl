Tightening the nut at a location with a spanner causes the nut to be not loose, the spanner to be unusable and the nut to be tightened.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, location1 is linked to location2, location4 is linked to location5, spanner1 is at location3, location3 is linked to location4, nut1 is at gate, spanner3 is usable, spanner2 is at location5, nut5 is loose, spanner5 is usable, spanner4 is at location6, spanner2 is usable, nut5 is at gate, location6 is linked to location7, nut2 is at gate, location2 is linked to location3, location9 is linked to gate, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is at location2, spanner1 is usable, location5 is linked to location6, nut1 is loose, spanner5 is at location3, spanner4 is usable, location8 is linked to location9, bob is at shed, nut3 is loose, location7 is linked to location8, nut4 is loose, nut3 is at gate, shed is linked to location1 and nut4 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob walks from shed to location1, bob walks from location1 to location2, bob picks up spanner3 from location2, bob walks from location2 to location3, bob picks up spanner5 from location3, bob picks up spanner1 from location3, bob walks from location3 to location4, bob walks from location4 to location5, bob picks up spanner2 from location5, bob walks from location5 to location6, bob picks up spanner4 from location6, bob walks from location6 to location7, bob walks from location7 to location8, bob walks from location8 to location9, bob walks from location9 to gate, bob tightens nut1 with spanner5 at gate, bob tightens nut2 with spanner4 at gate, bob tightens nut3 with spanner3 at gate and bob tightens nut4 with spanner2 at gate to reach the current state. In this state, some valid property of the state that involves a negation may or may not be defined. What valid property of the state that involves a negation out of, nut2 is not at location8, spanner3 is not at gate, nut1 is not at location3, location6 is not linked to location8, spanner1 is not at location5, location7 is not linked to location3, location8 is not linked to gate, gate is not linked to location7, gate is not linked to location1, location3 is not linked to shed, bob is not at location7, spanner1 is not at location6, shed is not linked to location3, nut2 is not at location4, location7 is not linked to shed, bob is not at location4, bob is not at location8, location4 is not linked to location3, shed is not linked to location8, location5 is not linked to location7, location4 is not linked to location7, location1 is not linked to location9, nut5 is not at location8, location1 is not linked to shed, spanner3 is not at location8, location4 is not linked to location2 and nut4 is not at location4, is not defined? Write None if all are defined.\n\n[ANSWER]:\n","output":"[ANSWER]:\nNone\n\n[EXPLANATION]\nThe valid property of the state that involves a negation that is not defined is nut2 is not at location8.\n\n[SOLUTION]\n\n[SOLUTION EXPLANATION]\n\n[SOLUTION]\n\n[SOLUTION EXPLANATION]\n\n[SOLUTION]\n\n[SOLUTION EXPLANATION]\n\n[SOLUT"}]

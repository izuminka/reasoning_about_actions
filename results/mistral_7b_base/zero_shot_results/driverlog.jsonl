Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

They depend on the current configuration of the blocks and the hand. In the initial condition, block b4 is on the table and is not being held by the hand. Therefore, the properties \"block b4 is not being held by the hand\" and \"block b4 is not on top of any block\" are true in the initial condition.\n\nThe actions performed in the question change the configuration of the blocks and the hand. However, the question asks about the properties of block b4 in the final state, which is not explicitly stated in the problem. To determine the truth value of the properties in the final state, we need to know the final configuration of the blocks and the hand.\n\nWithout this information, we cannot determine the truth value of the properties in the final state with certainty. Therefore, the answer is \"Unknown\" instead of \"True"}

When the action \"block b3 is unstacked from top of block b4\" is performed, block b3 becomes held in the hand. Therefore, the derived property \"hand is not empty\" is true. Since block b3 is not on any other block in the current state, the derived property \"block b3 is not on another block\" is also true. The base property \"block b4 is clear\" is true because block b3 is no longer on it.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties.

The state description does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of executable actions. However, based on the given actions, it is clear that at least three actions were performed. But, there could be additional actions that are also executable in the current state. For example, block b1 could be unstacked from block b7, or block b3 could be unstacked from block b4, or block b5 could be picked up and stacked on top of another block, etc. Without more information, it is impossible to determine the exact number of executable actions in the current state."}

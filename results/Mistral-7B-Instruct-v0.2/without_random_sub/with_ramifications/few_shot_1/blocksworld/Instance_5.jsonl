Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table.

The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves.

Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action. There are no static properties of the state in this domain. \n\n[EXAMPLE 1]\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, Block b1 is on top of block b4, block b2 is clear, block b2 is on block b6, block b3 is clear, block b3 is on block b5, block b4 is located on the table, block b5 is placed on top of block b7, block b6 is on the table, block b7 is on top of block b1 and hand is empty.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: block b3 is unstacked from top of block b5, block b3 is put down, block b2 is unstacked from block b6, the hand puts down the block b2, block b6 is picked up, on top of block b3, block b6 is stacked, block b5 is unstacked from top of block b7, on top of block b6, block b5 is stacked, from top of block b1, block b7 is unstacked, block b7 is put down on the table, block b1 is unstacked from block b4, block b1 is stacked on top of block b2, block b4 is picked up by the hand, on top of block b5, block b4 is stacked, block b1 is unstacked from top of block b2, on top of block b4, block b1 is stacked, block b2 is picked up, block b2 is stacked on top of block b1 and block b7 is picked up by the hand to reach the current state. In this state, some properties of the state may or may not be defined. What properties of the state out of, block b4 is not on top of block b7, block b6 is not on block b1, block b6 is not on block b4, block b6 is not placed on top of block b2, block b6 is on block b3, the hand is not holding the block b1 and the hand is not holding the block b5, is not defined? Write None if all are defined..\nProvide your final answer in between [[ and ]].\n\n[ANSWER]: [[None]]\n\n\nBased on the above examples, answer the below question:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, Block b1 is clear, block b1 is located on the table, block b2 is placed on top of block b3, block b3 is on block b5, block b4 is on top of block b2, block b5 is on top of block b9, block b6 is on the table, block b7 is clear, block b7 is on block b4, block b8 is clear, block b8 is located on the table, block b9 is on top of block b6 and hand is not holding anything.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are planned to be performed: block b7 is unstacked from top of block b4, the hand puts down the block b7, block b4 is unstacked from top of block b2, on top of block b7, block b4 is stacked, block b2 is unstacked from top of block b3, block b2 is stacked on top of block b1, block b3 is unstacked from block b5, block b3 is put down on the table, block b5 is unstacked from block b9, block b5 is put down on the table, block b2 is unstacked from top of block b1, on top of block b3, block b2 is stacked, block b8 is picked up by the hand, block b8 is crashed from block b4block b8 is crashed from top of block b4, from top of block b6, block b9 is unstacked, on top of block b8, block b9 is stacked, block b6 is picked up by the hand, block b6 is stacked on top of block b9 and block b1 is picked up from the table to reach the current state. Given this sequence, what action is not defined? Write None if all are defined..\nProvide your final answer in between [[ and ]].\n\n[ANSWER]:", "label": "[[block b8 is crashed from block b4block b8 is crashed from top of block b4]]", "id": "fc118b53-87c9-4734-9755-a25dc9e01d02", "response": " [[block b8 is stacked on top of block b4]]\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe question asks for the properties that are not defined in the current state, given the initial conditions and the sequence of actions. The properties listed in the question are all derived properties, which depend on the current state of the blocks and the hand.\n\nIn the initial conditions, all the blocks are located on the table or on top of other blocks, and the hand is not holding anything. Therefore, the properties \"block b4 is not on top of block b7\", \"block b6 is not on block b1\", \"block b6 is not on block b4\", \"block b6 is not placed on top of block b2\", \"block b6 is on block b3\", \"the hand is not holding the block b1\", and \"the hand is not holding the block b5\" are all defined.\n\nHowever, the property \"block"}

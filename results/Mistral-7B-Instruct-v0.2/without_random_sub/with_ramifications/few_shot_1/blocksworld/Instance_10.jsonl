Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves.

Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties.

Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table.

However, the initial condition states that block b9 is on top of block b7. In order to put down block b9, it must be held in the hand and the location where it is to be put down must be clear. Since the hand is empty and the table is clear, the condition for putting down block b9 is met.

In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action. There are no static properties of the state in this domain. \n\n[EXAMPLE 1]\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, Block b1 is placed on top of block b4, block b2 is clear, block b2 is on block b6, block b3 is clear, block b3 is on top of block b5, block b4 is located on the table, block b5 is on top of block b7, block b6 is located on the table, block b7 is placed on top of block b1 and hand is empty.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: from top of block b5, block b3 is unstacked, block b3 is put down on the table, from top of block b6, block b2 is unstacked, the hand puts down the block b2, block b6 is picked up, block b6 is stacked on top of block b3, from top of block b7, block b5 is unstacked, on top of block b6, block b5 is stacked, block b7 is unstacked from top of block b1 and block b7 is put down to reach the current state. In this state, list all executable actions. Write None if there are none..\nProvide your final answer in between [[ and ]].\n\n[ANSWER]: [[from top of block b6, block b5 is unstacked, block b7 is picked up by the hand, block b1 is unstacked from top of block b4 and block b2 is picked up]]\n\n\nBased on the above examples, answer the below question:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, Block b1 is placed on top of block b5, block b2 is on block b1, block b3 is on the table, block b4 is clear, block b4 is placed on top of block b8, block b5 is located on the table, block b6 is clear, block b6 is located on the table, block b7 is on block b3, block b8 is on block b2, block b9 is clear, block b9 is on top of block b7 and hand is empty.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: from top of block b8, block b4 is unstacked, block b4 is put down on the table, from top of block b7, block b9 is unstacked, the hand puts down the block b9, from top of block b2, block b8 is unstacked, block b8 is stacked on top of block b4, block b5 is picked up, on top of block b6, block b2 is stacked, from top of block b5, block b1 is unstacked and block b1 is stacked on top of block b9 to reach the current state. What is the first inexecutable action in the sequence? Write None if there are none..\nProvide your final answer in between [[ and ]].\n\n[ANSWER]:", "label": "[[block b5 is picked up]]", "id": "a67d8f51-8f1c-4f6d-be54-255e453ced54", "response": " [[from top of block b1, block b5 is unstacked]]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe first inexecutable action in the sequence is \"from top of block b1, block b5 is unstacked\" because block b5 is currently on top of block b1, but the hand is not empty (it is holding block b2), so the hand cannot pick up block b5 without first putting down block b2. Therefore, this action is not executable in the current state."}

Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

However, based on the information provided, it is likely that some of the properties are false, as there are blocks stacked on top of each other and being held by the hand, which would violate some of the stated properties if they were true.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held.

Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action. There are no static properties of the state in this domain. \n\n[EXAMPLE 1]\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, Block b1 is on top of block b4, block b2 is clear, block b2 is on top of block b6, block b3 is clear, block b3 is on block b5, block b4 is on the table, block b5 is placed on top of block b7, block b6 is on the table, block b7 is placed on top of block b1 and hand is empty.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: from top of block b5, block b3 is unstacked, the hand puts down the block b3, block b2 is unstacked from block b6, block b2 is put down on the table, block b6 is picked up, block b6 is stacked on top of block b3, from top of block b7, block b5 is unstacked, on top of block b6, block b5 is stacked, from top of block b1, block b7 is unstacked, block b7 is put down, block b1 is unstacked from top of block b4, on top of block b2, block b1 is stacked, block b4 is picked up by the hand, block b4 is stacked on top of block b5, from top of block b2, block b1 is unstacked, on top of block b4, block b1 is stacked, block b2 is picked up, on top of block b1, block b2 is stacked and block b7 is picked up to reach the current state.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties.

Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties.

Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block.

Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves.

Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties.

Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves.

In the current state, some blocks are stacked on top of others, and some blocks are being held in the hands, which limits the number of executable actions. To determine the exact number of executable actions in the current state, we would need to analyze the state in more detail and identify which blocks are clear and which hands are empty. In the given question, we are only asked to compare the number of executable actions to a specific value of 2, so we can answer that question with a simple true or false response"}
{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. Picking up the block leads to the block being held.

When block b3 is unstacked from block b5, block b3 is held in the hand and block b5 is left on the table. The state after unstacking is not explicitly mentioned in the question, but we can infer that block b3 is not on top of block b5 anymore. Therefore, block b6 is still on the table and the property \"block b6 is positioned under the table\" is not defined.\n\nHowever, the property \"block b4 is on the table and block b6 is positioned under the table\" is not valid in the initial state because block b6 is on the table, but not under block b4. Therefore, the answer is [[block b6 is not positioned under the table]]."}

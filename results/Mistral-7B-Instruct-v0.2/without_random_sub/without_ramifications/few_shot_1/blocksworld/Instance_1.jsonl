In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves.

Therefore, the answer is false.\n\n[ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION]\n\nAnother way to understand this is by considering the properties of the state. The property \"block b6 is not located on the table\" is a negation of the property \"block b6 is on the table.\" In the current state, the property \"block b6 is on block b3\" holds, which implies that block b6 is not on the table directly but is located on top of another block.

Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block. Furthermore, the hand is not empty.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action. There are no static properties of the state in this domain. \n\n[EXAMPLE 1]\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, Block b1 is located on the table, block b2 is clear, block b2 is on top of block b4, block b3 is on top of block b8, block b4 is on the table, block b5 is located on the table, block b6 is clear, block b6 is on block b3, block b7 is clear, block b7 is on block b1, block b8 is on top of block b5 and hand is empty.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: block b2 is unstacked from top of block b4, block b2 is stacked on top of block b6, from top of block b1, block b7 is unstacked, on top of block b4, block b7 is stacked, block b2 is unstacked from block b6, block b2 is stacked on top of block b7, block b1 is picked up by the hand, on top of block b2, block b1 is stacked, block b6 is unstacked from block b3, the hand puts down the block b6, block b3 is unstacked from block b8, block b3 is put down on the table, block b8 is unstacked from block b5, block b8 is stacked on top of block b1, block b6 is picked up, on top of block b8, block b6 is stacked, block b5 is picked up, block b5 is stacked on top of block b6 and block b3 is picked up by the hand to reach the current state.

In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action. There are no static properties of the state in this domain. \n\n[EXAMPLE 1]\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, Block b1 is located on the table, block b2 is clear, block b2 is on top of block b4, block b3 is on top of block b8, block b4 is on the table, block b5 is located on the table, block b6 is clear, block b6 is placed on top of block b3, block b7 is clear, block b7 is placed on top of block b1, block b8 is on top of block b5 and hand is not holding anything.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: from top of block b4, block b2 is unstacked to reach the current state.

In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action. There are no static properties of the state in this domain. \n\n[EXAMPLE 1]\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, Block b1 is located on the table, block b2 is clear, block b2 is on top of block b4, block b3 is on top of block b8, block b4 is on the table, block b5 is located on the table, block b6 is clear, block b6 is placed on top of block b3, block b7 is clear, block b7 is placed on top of block b1, block b8 is on top of block b5 and hand is not holding anything.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: block b2 is unstacked from block b4, block b2 is stacked on top of block b6, block b7 is unstacked from block b1, block b7 is stacked on top of block b4, from top of block b6, block b2 is unstacked, block b2 is stacked on top of block b7, block b1 is picked up by the hand, block b1 is stacked on top of block b2, from top of block b3, block b6 is unstacked and block b6 is put down on the table to reach the current state.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty.

It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

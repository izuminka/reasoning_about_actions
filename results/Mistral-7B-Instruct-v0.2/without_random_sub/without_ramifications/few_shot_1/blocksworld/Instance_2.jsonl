In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

Since the actions performed do not change the location of blocks b1 and b4, they remain true. Block b5 was on top of block b4 initially, but it is not mentioned in the question whether it is still on top of block b4 or not. However, since the question asks for the truth value of the properties \"block b1 is located on the table\", \"block b4 is located on the table\", and \"block b5 is on the table\", the answer is based on the given information and does not require the knowledge of the current position of block b5. Therefore, the answer is True."}

Block b1 is not clear because it was under block b7 before the unstacking of block b2 from block b4, and it remains under block b7 in the current state.\n2. Block b2 is not clear because it was being held in the hand during the unstacking action and is no longer on top of block b4.\n3.

It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block. Furthermore, the hand is not empty.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

The final state is not explicitly given in the problem statement, but we can infer it from the sequence of actions.\n\nFrom the sequence of actions, we can see that block b3 was not mentioned in any of the actions.

Furthermore, the hand is not empty.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action. There are no static properties of the state in this domain. \n\n[EXAMPLE 1]\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, Block b1 is on block b4, block b2 is clear, block b2 is on block b6, block b3 is clear, block b3 is on block b5, block b4 is located on the table, block b5 is on top of block b7, block b6 is on the table, block b7 is on top of block b1 and hand is empty.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: block b3 is unstacked from block b5, block b3 is put down on the table, block b2 is unstacked from top of block b6, the hand puts down the block b2 and block b6 is picked up to reach the current state.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

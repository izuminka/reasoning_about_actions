Based on the initial conditions and the actions performed, the following is the explanation:\n\nThe initial conditions state that block b9 is placed on top of block b6. However, the actions performed include unstacking block b5 from block b9 and putting it down on the table, which means that block b9 is no longer on top of block b6.\n\nThe question also asks whether various other properties are true or false for block b9. Since the initial conditions state that block b9 is not on top of block b1, block b2, block b3, block b5, block b7, or block b8, and the actions performed do not involve any of these blocks being placed on top of block b9, all of these properties are true.\n\nAdditionally, the question"}

Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves.

The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block.

Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block.

In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves.

{"prompt": "[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]\n\nPicking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block. Furthermore, the hand is not empty.\n\nA state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is on the table and a block is not on the table. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend on other properties. In this domain, they are: a block is clear, hand is empty, a block is not clear and hand is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend on themselves. In this domain, they are: a block is being held, a block is on another block, a block is not being held and a block is not on another block. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action. There are no static properties of the state in this domain. \n\n[EXAMPLE 1]\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, Block b1 is on top of block b4, block b2 is clear, block b2 is on top of block b6, block b3 is clear, block b3 is on block b5, block b4 is on the table, block b5 is placed on top of block b7, block b6 is on the table, block b7 is placed on top of block b1 and hand is empty.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: from top of block b5, block b3 is unstacked, block b3 is put down on the table, from top of block b6, block b2 is unstacked, block b2 is put down on the table and block b6 is picked up from the table to reach the current state.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it. When a vehicle is unloaded, cargo is no longer in the vehicle, cargo is at a location, the vehicle no longer has the initial space, and there is a secondary space.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level f6 neighbours fuel level f7, space s0 neighbours space s1, cargo c6 is at location l1, cargo c7 is at location l1, cargo c0 is at location l1, location l0 has fuel f5, cargo c4 is at location l1, vehicle v0 has space s1, fuel level f2 neighbours fuel level f3, location l0 is connected to location l1, cargo c2 is at location l1, vehicle v1 has space s1, location l1 has fuel f7, cargo c1 is at location l1, fuel level f4 neighbours fuel level f5, fuel level f0 neighbours fuel level f1, fuel level f5 neighbours fuel level f6, fuel level f1 neighbours fuel level f2, fuel level f3 neighbours fuel level f4, cargo v0 is at location l0, cargo c8 is at location l0, location l1 is connected to location l0, cargo v1 is at location l1, cargo c5 is at location l0 and cargo c3 is at location l0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f5 and f4 to reach the current state.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

and space s0 at location l1 to reach the current state. In this state, list all inexecutable actions. Write None if there are none.\n\n[ANSWER]:\n","response":"model input too long"},{"id":"7c0537a1-58c9-4ad1-a97e-b43919796d5c","plan_length":1,"question_category":"action_executability","question_name":"question_5","answer_type":"free_answer","prompt":"A vehicle has a set of spaces inside next to each other for carrying cargo. Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

However, it is important to note that the sequence of actions may not lead to the desired state, as there may be other constraints that need to be considered. For example, if there is not enough fuel at the initial location for the vehicle to move to the next location, then the vehicle cannot move even if there is space in the vehicle and cargo at the initial location. Similarly, if there is no cargo at a location, then cargo cannot be loaded into a vehicle even if there is space and the vehicle is at the location. Therefore, it is important to consider all the constraints before determining if a sequence of actions is executable or not.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it. When a vehicle is unloaded, cargo is no longer in the vehicle, cargo is at a location, the vehicle no longer has the initial space, and there is a secondary space.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level f6 neighbours fuel level f7, space s0 neighbours space s1, cargo c6 is at location l1, cargo c7 is at location l1, cargo c0 is at location l1, location l0 has fuel f5, cargo c4 is at location l1, vehicle v0 has space s1, fuel level f2 neighbours fuel level f3, location l0 is connected to location l1, cargo c2 is at location l1, vehicle v1 has space s1, location l1 has fuel f7, cargo c1 is at location l1, fuel level f4 neighbours fuel level f5, fuel level f0 neighbours fuel level f1, fuel level f5 neighbours fuel level f6, fuel level f1 neighbours fuel level f2, fuel level f3 neighbours fuel level f4, cargo v0 is at location l0, cargo c8 is at location l0, location l1 is connected to location l0, cargo v1 is at location l1, cargo c5 is at location l0 and cargo c3 is at location l0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f1 and f7, cargo c0 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f7 and f6, cargo c0 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0 and vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f4 and f3 to reach the current state.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it. When a vehicle is unloaded, cargo is no longer in the vehicle, cargo is at a location, the vehicle no longer has the initial space, and there is a secondary space.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level f6 neighbours fuel level f7, space s0 neighbours space s1, cargo c6 is at location l1, cargo c7 is at location l1, cargo c0 is at location l1, location l0 has fuel f5, cargo c4 is at location l1, vehicle v0 has space s1, fuel level f2 neighbours fuel level f3, location l0 is connected to location l1, cargo c2 is at location l1, vehicle v1 has space s1, location l1 has fuel f7, cargo c1 is at location l1, fuel level f4 neighbours fuel level f5, fuel level f0 neighbours fuel level f1, fuel level f5 neighbours fuel level f6, fuel level f1 neighbours fuel level f2, fuel level f3 neighbours fuel level f4, cargo v0 is at location l0, cargo c8 is at location l0, location l1 is connected to location l0, cargo v1 is at location l1, cargo c5 is at location l0 and cargo c3 is at location l0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c0 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f7 and f6, cargo c0 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f4 and f3, cargo c1 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f6 and f5, cargo c1 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f3 and f2 and cargo c2 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1 to reach the current state.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it. When a vehicle is unloaded, cargo is no longer in the vehicle, cargo is at a location, the vehicle no longer has the initial space, and there is a secondary space.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level f6 neighbours fuel level f7, space s0 neighbours space s1, cargo c6 is at location l1, cargo c7 is at location l1, cargo c0 is at location l1, location l0 has fuel f5, cargo c4 is at location l1, vehicle v0 has space s1, fuel level f2 neighbours fuel level f3, location l0 is connected to location l1, cargo c2 is at location l1, vehicle v1 has space s1, location l1 has fuel f7, cargo c1 is at location l1, fuel level f4 neighbours fuel level f5, fuel level f0 neighbours fuel level f1, fuel level f5 neighbours fuel level f6, fuel level f1 neighbours fuel level f2, fuel level f3 neighbours fuel level f4, cargo v0 is at location l0, cargo c8 is at location l0, location l1 is connected to location l0, cargo v1 is at location l1, cargo c5 is at location l0 and cargo c3 is at location l0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c0 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f7 and f6, cargo c0 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f4 and f3, cargo c1 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f6 and f5, cargo c1 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f3 and f2 and cargo c2 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1 to reach the current state.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it. When a vehicle is unloaded, cargo is no longer in the vehicle, cargo is at a location, the vehicle no longer has the initial space, and there is a secondary space.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level f6 neighbours fuel level f7, space s0 neighbours space s1, cargo c6 is at location l1, cargo c7 is at location l1, cargo c0 is at location l1, location l0 has fuel f5, cargo c4 is at location l1, vehicle v0 has space s1, fuel level f2 neighbours fuel level f3, location l0 is connected to location l1, cargo c2 is at location l1, vehicle v1 has space s1, location l1 has fuel f7, cargo c1 is at location l1, fuel level f4 neighbours fuel level f5, fuel level f0 neighbours fuel level f1, fuel level f5 neighbours fuel level f6, fuel level f1 neighbours fuel level f2, fuel level f3 neighbours fuel level f4, cargo v0 is at location l0, cargo c8 is at location l0, location l1 is connected to location l0, cargo v1 is at location l1, cargo c5 is at location l0 and cargo c3 is at location l0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c0 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f7 and f6, cargo c0 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f4 and f3, cargo c1 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f6 and f5, cargo c1 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f3 and f2, cargo c2 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c2 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f2 and f1, cargo c4 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1 and vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f4 and f3 to reach the current state.

Locations can have sets of fuel that neighbor each other. A vehicle can move from the initial to the final location if it is currently at the initial location, the initial and final locations are connected, the initial location has fuel, and there is an additional fuel next to it. As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it. When a vehicle is unloaded, cargo is no longer in the vehicle, cargo is at a location, the vehicle no longer has the initial space, and there is a secondary space.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level f6 neighbours fuel level f7, space s0 neighbours space s1, cargo c6 is at location l1, cargo c7 is at location l1, cargo c0 is at location l1, location l0 has fuel f5, cargo c4 is at location l1, vehicle v0 has space s1, fuel level f2 neighbours fuel level f3, location l0 is connected to location l1, cargo c2 is at location l1, vehicle v1 has space s1, location l1 has fuel f7, cargo c1 is at location l1, fuel level f4 neighbours fuel level f5, fuel level f0 neighbours fuel level f1, fuel level f5 neighbours fuel level f6, fuel level f1 neighbours fuel level f2, fuel level f3 neighbours fuel level f4, cargo v0 is at location l0, cargo c8 is at location l0, location l1 is connected to location l0, cargo v1 is at location l1, cargo c5 is at location l0 and cargo c3 is at location l0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c0 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f7 and f6, cargo c0 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f4 and f3, cargo c1 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f6 and f5, cargo c1 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f3 and f2, cargo c2 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c2 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f2 and f1, cargo c4 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f4 and f3, cargo c4 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f1 and f0, cargo c6 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1 and vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f3 and f2 to reach the current state.

In this case, we are given that cargo c1 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1.\n\nFirst, let's check the conditions for loading cargo:\n1. Cargo is at a location\n2. The vehicle is at the same location\n3. The vehicle has space\n4. There is an additional space in the vehicle\n\nFrom the initial conditions, we can see that cargo c1 is at location l1, vehicle v0 is at location l1, vehicle v0 has space s1, and there is an additional space s0 in vehicle v0. Therefore, the condition for loading cargo is met.\n\nNow, let's check the conditions for inexecutable actions:\n1. A vehicle cannot move to a location that does not have fuel if it is not currently at that location and there is no additional fuel next to it.\n2. A vehicle cannot move to a location that is not connected to its current location.\n3. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel.\n4. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no space for cargo.\n5. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no space for itself.\n6.

A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel for the previous move.\n9. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel for the current move.\n10. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel for the next move in the direction it is moving.\n11. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel for the previous move in the direction it is moving.\n12.

A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel for the next move in the opposite direction.\n14. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel for the previous move in the opposite direction.\n15. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel for the current move in the opposite direction.\n16. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel for the next move in a diagonal direction.\n17. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel for the previous move in a diagonal direction.\n18. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no fuel for the current move in a diagonal direction.\n19. A vehicle cannot move to a location that has no cargo if it is not currently at that location and there is no additional cargo next to it.\n20.

A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it. When a vehicle is unloaded, cargo is no longer in the vehicle, cargo is at a location, the vehicle no longer has the initial space, and there is a secondary space.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level f6 neighbours fuel level f7, space s0 neighbours space s1, cargo c6 is at location l1, cargo c7 is at location l1, cargo c0 is at location l1, location l0 has fuel f5, cargo c4 is at location l1, vehicle v0 has space s1, fuel level f2 neighbours fuel level f3, location l0 is connected to location l1, cargo c2 is at location l1, vehicle v1 has space s1, location l1 has fuel f7, cargo c1 is at location l1, fuel level f4 neighbours fuel level f5, fuel level f0 neighbours fuel level f1, fuel level f5 neighbours fuel level f6, fuel level f1 neighbours fuel level f2, fuel level f3 neighbours fuel level f4, cargo v0 is at location l0, cargo c8 is at location l0, location l1 is connected to location l0, cargo v1 is at location l1, cargo c5 is at location l0 and cargo c3 is at location l0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c0 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f7 and f6, cargo c0 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f4 and f3, cargo c1 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f6 and f5, cargo c1 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f3 and f2, cargo c2 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c2 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f2 and f1, cargo c4 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1 and vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f4 and f3 to reach the current state.

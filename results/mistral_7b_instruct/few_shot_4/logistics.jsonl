In this state, is it True or False that object p0 is not at airport l0_0?\n\n[ANSWER]:\n","response":"[ANSWER]:\nFalse.\n\n[EXPLANATION]:\nThe initial condition states that object p0 is at airport l1_2. When the action \"package p0 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_2\" is performed, the package p0 is moved from airport l1_2 to truck t1. However, the location of the object p0 in the truck t1 is not explicitly stated in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact location of object p0 in the current state.\n\nHowever, we can determine that the initial condition states that object a0 is at airport l1_0, which is in city c1. Since the initial condition does not state that any action is performed on object a0, we can assume that it is still at airport l1_0 in the current state. Therefore, since object p0 was loaded into truck t1 with package p0, and truck t1 was previously at airport l1_2 (where object p0 was initially located), we can infer that object p0 is currently in truck t1, which is not at airport l0_0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is False. However, it is important to note that this answer is based on the assumption that object p0 is not in the truck t1 but in the current location, which is not explicitly stated in the problem statement. If the problem statement states that the current state includes the location of all objects, including those in vehicles, then the answer would be different."},{"id":"e707f6c8-0331-4e09-ad13-e424438f68b6","plan_length":1,"question_category":"fluent_tracking","question_name":"question_3","answer_type":"true_false_answer","prompt":"Loading a package onto a truck is only possible if both the package and the truck are in the same location.

Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source.

Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be not at the source location but at the destination location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l0_0 to airport l1_0, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_0 to airport l1_1 in city c1, package p3 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p2 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p1 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0 and airplane a0 is flown from airport l1_0 to airport l0_0 to reach the current state.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be not at the source location but at the destination location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l0_0 to airport l1_0, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_0 to airport l1_1 in city c1, package p3 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p2 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p1 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l1_0 to airport l0_0, package p2 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l0_0, package p1 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l0_0, package p1 is loaded in truck t0 at airport l0_0 and truck t0 is driven from airport l0_0 to airport l0_1 in city c0 to reach the current state.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be not at the source location but at the destination location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1 to reach the current state.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be not at the source location but at the destination location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, package p2 is unloaded from truck t0 at airport l0_1, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0 and package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0 to reach the current state.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be not at the source location but at the destination location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l0_0 to airport l1_0, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_0 to airport l1_1 in city c1, package p3 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p2 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p1 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0 and airplane a0 is flown from airport l1_0 to airport l0_0 to reach the current state.

The reason is that the initial condition states that object p3 is at airport l0_2, and it was not mentioned that it was moved during the sequence of actions. Therefore, it is still at airport l0_2 and not at airport l0_1. Additionally, the question asks if package p0 is not in vehicle t1, but the sequence of actions did not involve loading or unloading package p0 from truck t1. Therefore, the answer is that both statements are False."},{"id":"d1329f9f-7839-45e9-94c7-ef082148e28f","plan_length":5,"question_category":"effects","question_name":"question_3","answer_type":"free_answer","prompt":"Loading a package onto a truck is only possible if both the package and the truck are in the same location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be not at the source location but at the destination location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l0_0 to airport l1_0, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_0 to airport l1_1 in city c1, package p3 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p2 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p1 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0 and airplane a0 is flown from airport l1_0 to airport l0_0 to reach the current state.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location.

However, since the question asks if the number of objects is equal to 16, and it is not, the answer is False.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the question contains a mistake. The question asks if the number of objects is equal to 16, but the initial state has only 13 objects. Therefore, the question is not answerable based on the given information.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, the initial state should have 16 objects, and the actions performed should add or remove objects to or from the state to make the number of objects equal to 16.\n\nFor example, if the initial state has 16 objects, and the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, then the number of objects in the state would still be 16, so the answer would be True.\n\nTherefore, the question should be corrected to reflect the correct initial state and the correct number of objects in the final state."},{"id":"9998ccd6-c555-4bc1-bf45-d89d12478c42","plan_length":1,"question_category":"numerical_reasoning","question_name":"question_2","answer_type":"true_false_answer","prompt":"Loading a package onto a truck is only possible if both the package and the truck are in the same location.

Loading a package onto a truck: Package p0 is at airport l1_2, and truck t1 is also at airport l1_2. Both are in the same location, so this action is executable.\n2. Driving a truck: Truck t1 is at airport l1_2, and the source and destination are not in the same city (l1_2 is in city c1, while l0_2 is in city c0). Therefore, this action is inexecutable.\n3. Flying an airplane: There is no airplane in the current state.\n4. Unloading from a truck: Truck t1 is at airport l1_2, but package p0 is not in the truck (it is in the airport).

Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be not at the source location but at the destination location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l0_0 to airport l1_0, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0 and package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0 to reach the current state.

In this state, what is the number of actions that led to the current state in the sequence before the first inexecutable action? Write as a decimal. Write None if there are none.\n\n[ANSWER]:\n","response":"[ANSWER]:\n\nThe number of actions that led to the current state in the sequence before the first inexecutable action is 11.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe initial condition states that there are several objects and airports in different cities. The actions planned to be performed include loading and unloading packages into trucks and airplanes, and driving trucks and flying airplanes between airports.\n\nTo determine the number of actions that led to the current state in the sequence before the first inexecutable action, we need to count the number of actions that were executed before encountering an inexecutable action. In this case, the first inexecutable action is not specified in the question, so we cannot directly answer that part of the question. However, we can determine the number of actions that led to the current state by counting the number of actions that were executed before reaching the current state.\n\nFrom the given actions, we can see that there are a total of 12 actions that were planned to be performed:\n\n1. Package p0 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_2\n2. Truck t1 is driven from airport l1_2 to airport l1_1 in city c1\n3. Package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1\n4.

Package p2 is unloaded from truck t0 at airport l0_0\n11. Package p1 is loaded into airplane a1 at airport l1_0\n12. Package p0 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l0_0\n\nThe first action is the loading of package p0 into truck t1 at airport l1_2. This action is executable, as both the package and the truck are at the same location (airport l1_2).\n\nThe next action is the driving of truck t1 from airport l1_2 to airport l1_1 in city c1. This action is also executable, as both the truck and the destination airport are at the same location (airport l1_1) when the action is performed.\n\nThe third action is the loading of package p1 into truck t1 at airport l1_1. This action is executable, as both the package and the truck are at the same location (airport l1_1).\n\nThe fourth action is the driving of truck t1 from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1. This action is executable, as both the truck and the destination airport are at the same location (airport l1_0) when the action is performed.\n\nThe fifth action is the unloading of package p1 from truck t1 at airport l1_0. This action is executable, as both the package and the truck are at the same location (airport l1_0) when the action is performed.\n\nThe sixth action is the unloading of package p0 from truck t1 at airport l1_0. This action is executable, as both the package and the truck are at the same location (airport l1_0) when the action is performed.\n\nThe seventh action is the loading of package p3 into truck t0 at airport l0_2. This action is executable, as both the package and the truck are at the same location (airport l0_2) when the action is performed.\n\nThe eighth action is the loading of package p2 into truck t0 at airport l0_2. This action is executable, as both the package and the truck are at the same location (airport l0_2) when the action is performed.\n\nThe ninth action is the driving of truck t0 from airport l0_2 to airport l0_0 in city c0. This action is executable, as both the truck and the destination airport are at the same location (airport l0_0) when the action is performed.\n\nThe tenth action is the unloading of package p2 from truck t0 at airport l0_0. This action is executable, as both the package and the truck are at the same location (airport l0_0) when the action is performed.\n\nThe eleventh action is the loading of package p1 into airplane a1 at airport l1_0. This action is executable, as both the package and the airplane are at the same location (airport l1_0) when the action is performed.\n\nThe twelfth action is the loading of package p0 into truck t1 at airport l0_0. This action is executable, as both the package and the truck are at the same location (airport l0_0) when the action is performed.\n\nTherefore, all"},{"id":"e720fd67-8acd-45b6-b012-354b784fe700","plan_length":19,"question_category":"numerical_reasoning","question_name":"question_1","answer_type":"true_false_answer","prompt":"Loading a package onto a truck is only possible if both the package and the truck are in the same location.

In this state, is the number of executable actions equal to 21? True or False\n\n[ANSWER]:\n","response":"[ANSWER]:\n\nTrue.\n\nThe number of executable actions is the number of actions that can be performed given the current state of the system. In this case, the initial conditions specify that there are 13 objects (6 packages and 7 vehicles) at various locations, and each object can be loaded or unloaded from a vehicle or an airplane, or a vehicle can be driven from one location to another. Based on the actions performed, it is clear that each package was loaded and unloaded twice (once from a truck and once from an airplane), and each truck was driven three times (once from its initial location to a loading location, once from a loading location to an unloading location, and once from an unloading location back to its initial location). Additionally, each airplane was flown twice (once from a loading location to an unloading location, and once from an unloading location back to a loading location). Therefore, the total number of executable actions is:\n\n- 6 packages \u00d7 2 loadings \u00d7 2 unloadings = 12 loadings and unloadings\n- 6 packages \u00d7 2 airplane loadings = 12 airplane loadings\n- 3 trucks \u00d7 3 drivings = 9 truck drivings\n- 2 airplanes \u00d7 2 flyings = 4 airplane flyings\n\nThus, the total number of executable actions is 12 + 12 + 9 + 4 = 37.\n\nHowever, the question asks if the number of executable actions is equal to 21. To answer this question, we need to count the number of executable actions based on the given actions performed. Let's go through each action and count how many executable actions it corresponds to:\n\n1. package p0 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_2\n   - This action corresponds to one loading action for package p0 and one driving action for truck t1.\n2. truck t1 is driven from airport l1_2 to airport l1_1 in city c1\n   - This action corresponds to one driving action for truck t1.\n3. package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1\n   - This action corresponds to one loading action for package p1 and one driving action for truck t1.\n4. truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1\n   - This action corresponds to one driving action for truck t1.\n5. package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0\n   - This action corresponds to one unloading action for package p1.\n6. package p0 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0\n   - This action corresponds to one unloading action for package p0.\n7. package p3 is loaded in truck t0 at airport l0_2\n   - This action corresponds to one loading action for package p3 and one driving action for truck t0.\n8. package p2 is loaded in truck t0 at airport l0_2\n   - This action corresponds to one loading action for package p2 and one driving action for truck t0.\n9. truck t0 is driven from airport l0_2 to airport l0_0 in city c0\n   - This action corresponds to one driving action for truck t0.\n10. package p2 is unloaded from truck t0 at airport l0_0\n    - This action corresponds to one unloading action for package p2.\n11. package p1 is loaded into airplane a1 at airport l1_0\n    - This action corresponds to one loading action for package p1 and one flying action for airplane a1.\n12. package p0 is loaded into airplane a1 at airport l1_0\n    - This action corresponds to one loading action for package p0 and one flying action for airplane a1.\n13. airplane a1 is flown from airport l1_0 to airport l0_0\n    - This action corresponds to one flying action for airplane a1.\n14. package p"},{"id":"612af76a-0d38-46dd-940e-13736973dd35","plan_length":19,"question_category":"numerical_reasoning","question_name":"question_3","answer_type":"true_false_answer","prompt":"Loading a package onto a truck is only possible if both the package and the truck are in the same location.

The valid properties of the state are those that can be determined based on the initial conditions and the actions performed. In this case, the valid properties include the location of each object and airport, the contents of each vehicle, and whether an airport has been scanned or not.\n\nThe initial conditions specify the location of each object and airport, as well as the contents of each vehicle. After the sequence of actions, some of these properties have been modified. For example, package p0 and p1 have been transferred between trucks and airplanes, and their current locations are different. Similarly, package p2 has been transferred between trucks and an airplane, and its current location is also different.\n\nHowever, none of the valid properties listed in the question are not defined after the sequence of actions. All of them can be determined based on the initial conditions and the actions performed. Therefore, the answer is None."},{"id":"c38fd180-1099-4aa2-b5e8-7f87e0081ff4","plan_length":15,"question_category":"hallucination","question_name":"question_8","answer_type":"free_answer","prompt":"Loading a package onto a truck is only possible if both the package and the truck are in the same location.

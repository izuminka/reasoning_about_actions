Vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f6 and f5.\n3. Cargo c1 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0.\n4. Vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f7 and f6.\n5. Cargo c4 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1.\n\nNow, let's think step by step to determine whether cargo c9 is not in vehicle v0.\n\nAfter the first action, cargo c1 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1. This means that cargo c9 is still at location l1, and it is not in vehicle v0.\n\nAfter the second action, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f6 and f5. This does not affect the location of cargo c9, as it is still at location l1.\n\nAfter the third action, cargo c1 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0. This does not affect the location of cargo c9 either, as it is still at location l1.\n\nAfter the fourth action, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f7 and f6. This does not affect the location of cargo c9 either, as it is still at location l1.\n\nFinally, after the fifth action, cargo c4 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1. This means that cargo c9 is still at location l1, and it is not in vehicle v0.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is it True or False that cargo c9 is not in vehicle v0?\" is True."}

As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location.

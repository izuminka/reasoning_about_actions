locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

As a helpful and respectful assistant, I'm here to answer your questions while ensuring a safe and positive experience. I understand that you have provided a complex scenario with multiple locations and objects. To answer your question, I will need to break down the scenario into smaller parts and address each aspect individually.\n\nFirstly, I would like to point out that some of the locations and objects mentioned in the scenario are not valid or do not make sense. For example, there is no location called \"f0_0f\" or \"f1_0f,\" and there is no object called \"hard rock\" or \"soft rock\" at any location. Additionally, some of the connections mentioned are not possible, such as a connection between \"location f0_1f\" and \"location f1_4f.\"\n\nTo answer your question, I will assume that the given scenario is a valid representation of a robotic arm's movements and interactions with objects in a specific environment. Based on the initial conditions provided, the following statements are true:\n\n1. Bomb is not at location f0_1f.\n2. There is no connection between location f3_1f and location f0_1f.\n3. There is no connection between location f1_0f and location f0_1f.\n4. There is no connection between location f3_4f and location f0_1f.\n5. There is no connection between location f0_1f and f1_4f.\n6. There is no connection between location f0_1f and f0_4f.\n7. There is no connection between location f1_3f and f0_1f.\n8. There is no connection between location f0_3f and f0_1f.\n9. Robot is not at location f0_1f.\n10. There is no connection between location f2_1f and f0_1f.\n11. There is no connection between location f0_1f and f1_1f.\n12. Laser is not at location f0_1f.\n13. There is no connection between location f0_1f and f1_2f.\n14. There is no connection between location f0_1f and f2_2f.\n15. There is no connection between location f2_2f and f0_1f.\n16. There is no connection between location f0_2f and f0_1f.\n17. There is no connection between location f0_1f and f2_1f.\n18. There is no connection between location f1_4f and f0_1f.\n19. There is no connection between location f3_3f and f0_1f.\n20. There is no connection between location f0_1f and f1_3f.\n\nBased on the above statements, we can conclude that the bomb is not present at location f0_1f, and there are no connections between any of the locations mentioned. Additionally, the robot is not present at location f0_1f, and there are no lasers or hard rocks at any location. The gold is also not present at location f0_1f.\n\nPlease note that I have only addressed the questions and statements provided in the initial conditions. If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify any points, please feel free to ask!"}

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

I'm here to help you with your question. However, I notice that some of the connections you've mentioned are not valid or do not make sense.\n\nFor example, there is no connection between location f0_0f and location f0_2f, as there is no direct path between these two locations. Additionally, there is no connection between location f0_4f and location f0_2f, as there is no direct path between these two locations.\n\nFurthermore, there is no connection between location f0_2f and location f1_0f, as the robot cannot move from one location to another without a direct path. Similarly, there is no connection between location f0_3f and location f0_2f, as there is no direct path between these two locations.\n\nLastly, there is no connection between location f2_2f and location f0_2f, as there is no direct path between these two locations.\n\nIn light of these observations, I cannot confirm whether the statements you've mentioned are true or false.

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

The actions performed do not provide enough information to determine the truth value of any of the statements.\n\nFor example, the statement \"there is no connection between location f1_4f and location f1_2f\" cannot be determined as true or false based on the actions performed, as there is no information provided about the connections between these locations. Similarly, the statement \"laser is not at location f1_2f\" cannot be determined as true or false based on the actions performed, as there is no information provided about the location of the laser.\n\nIn general, to determine the truth value of a statement about the connections between locations, it would be necessary to have information about the current state of the game board, including the locations of all objects and the connections between them. Without this information, it is not possible to determine the truth value of any statements about the connections between locations."}

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

locations are connected, and the destination is clear. Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a connection between location f2_3f and location f1_3f, there

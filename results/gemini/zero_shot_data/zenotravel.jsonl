Debarking a person in a city is executable if the person is in the aircraft and the aircraft is present in the city. Debarking a person in the city causes the person to be present in the city and not present in the aircraft. Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level. Flying the aircraft from a city to a destination city causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft to the next level. Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down. Refueling the aircraft in a city is executable if the aircraft is in the city. It changes the current fuel level to its next level.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, person5 is at city1, person6 is at city2, fuel level fl1 is next to fuel level fl0, plane1 is at city1, fuel level fl4 is next to fuel level fl3, person7 is at city0, plane1 has fuel level fl0, person4 is at city0, fuel level fl6 is next to fuel level fl5, fuel level fl3 is next to fuel level fl2, fuel level fl2 is next to fuel level fl1, person3 is at city1, person2 is at city1, fuel level fl5 is next to fuel level fl4 and person1 is at city1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: plane1 gets refueled at city1 with fuel level fl0 to fl1 to reach the current state.

Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down.

Debarking a person in the city causes the person to be present in the city and not present in the aircraft. Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level. Flying the aircraft from a city to a destination city causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft to the next level. Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down.

Debarking a person in a city is executable if the person is in the aircraft and the aircraft is present in the city. Debarking a person in the city causes the person to be present in the city and not present in the aircraft. Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level. Flying the aircraft from a city to a destination city causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft to the next level. Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down. Refueling the aircraft in a city is executable if the aircraft is in the city. It changes the current fuel level to its next level.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, person5 is at city1, person6 is at city2, fuel level fl1 is next to fuel level fl0, plane1 is at city1, fuel level fl4 is next to fuel level fl3, person7 is at city0, plane1 has fuel level fl0, person4 is at city0, fuel level fl6 is next to fuel level fl5, fuel level fl3 is next to fuel level fl2, fuel level fl2 is next to fuel level fl1, person3 is at city1, person2 is at city1, fuel level fl5 is next to fuel level fl4 and person1 is at city1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: plane1 gets refueled at city1 with fuel level fl0 to fl1, plane1 flies from city1 to city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl0, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl0 to fl1, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl2, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl2 to fl3, person7 boards plane1 at city0, person4 boards plane1 at city0, plane1 flies from city0 to city1 with fuel level fl3 to fl2, person7 departs plane1 at city1, person5 boards plane1 at city1, person3 boards plane1 at city1, person2 boards plane1 at city1, plane1 flies from city1 to city2 with fuel level fl2 to fl1, person6 boards plane1 at city2, person5 departs plane1 at city2, person4 departs plane1 at city2, person3 departs plane1 at city2, person2 departs plane1 at city2 and plane1 flies from city2 to city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl0 to reach the current state.

Boarding a person in the city causes the person to be in the aircraft and not present in the city. Debarking a person in a city is executable if the person is in the aircraft and the aircraft is present in the city. Debarking a person in the city causes the person to be present in the city and not present in the aircraft. Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level. Flying the aircraft from a city to a destination city causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft to the next level. Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down.

Boarding a person in the city causes the person to be in the aircraft and not present in the city. Debarking a person in a city is executable if the person is in the aircraft and the aircraft is present in the city. Debarking a person in the city causes the person to be present in the city and not present in the aircraft. Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level. Flying the aircraft from a city to a destination city causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft to the next level. Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down.

Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level. Flying the aircraft from a city to a destination city causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft to the next level. Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down.

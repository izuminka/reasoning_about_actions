The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block. Furthermore, the hand is not empty.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, block b5 is on block b9, block b6 is on the table, block b7 is on block b4, block b1 is clear, block b1 is on the table, block b7 is clear, block b4 is on block b2, hand is empty, block b9 is on block b6, block b8 is on the table, block b8 is clear, block b3 is on block b5 and block b2 is on block b3\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: unstack block b7 from block b4, put down block b7, unstack block b4 from block b2, stack block b4 on block b7 and unstack block b2 from block b3 to reach the current state.

Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block. Furthermore, the hand is not empty.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, block b5 is on block b9, block b6 is on the table, block b7 is on block b4, block b1 is clear, block b1 is on the table, block b7 is clear, block b4 is on block b2, hand is empty, block b9 is on block b6, block b8 is on the table, block b8 is clear, block b3 is on block b5 and block b2 is on block b3\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: unstack block b7 from block b4, put down block b7, unstack block b4 from block b2, stack block b4 on block b7, unstack block b2 from block b3, stack block b2 on block b1, unstack block b3 from block b5, put down block b3, unstack block b5 from block b9, put down block b5, unstack block b2 from block b1, stack block b2 on block b3, pickup block b8, stack block b8 on block b4 and unstack block b9 from block b6 to reach the current state.

Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block.

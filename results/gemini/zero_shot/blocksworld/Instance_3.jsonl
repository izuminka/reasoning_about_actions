The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block.

The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block.

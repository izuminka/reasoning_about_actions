A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck.

Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, pallet1 is clear, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is at depot3, crate2 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot3, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is on pallet5, truck2 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, crate3 is at distributor1, hoist6 is available, pallet6 is at distributor2, pallet2 is clear, hoist0 is available, crate2 is on pallet0, truck1 is at distributor0, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, crate1 is on pallet3, pallet3 is at depot3, truck0 is at depot1, hoist5 is at distributor1, pallet4 is clear, crate0 is at distributor2, crate2 is clear, hoist4 is at distributor0, crate0 is clear, hoist1 is available, crate0 is on pallet6, crate1 is clear, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist4 is available, hoist5 is available, crate3 is clear, hoist3 is available, hoist6 is at distributor2, pallet4 is at distributor0, pallet5 is at distributor1 and pallet2 is at depot2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot1 to depot0, hoist0 lifts crate2 from pallet0 at depot0, crate2 is loaded by hoist0 into truck2 at depot0, truck2 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, hoist3 lifts crate1 from pallet3 at depot3, hoist5 lifts crate3 from pallet5 at distributor1, crate3 is loaded by hoist5 into truck2 at distributor1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist5 from truck2 at distributor1, truck2 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2, hoist5 drops crate2 on pallet5 at distributor1, hoist6 lifts crate0 from pallet6 at distributor2, crate0 is loaded by hoist6 into truck2 at distributor2, truck2 is driven from distributor2 to depot3, crate1 is loaded by hoist3 into truck2 at depot3, crate0 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck2 at depot3, truck2 is driven from depot3 to distributor0, crate3 is unloaded by hoist4 from truck2 at distributor0, hoist3 drops crate0 on pallet3 at depot3 and hoist4 drops crate3 on pallet4 at distributor0 to reach the current state.

crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, pallet1 is clear, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is at depot3, crate2 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot3, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is on pallet5, truck2 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, crate3 is at distributor1, hoist6 is available, pallet6 is at distributor2, pallet2 is clear, hoist0 is available, crate2 is on pallet0, truck1 is at distributor0, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, crate1 is on pallet3, pallet3 is at depot3, truck0 is at depot1, hoist5 is at distributor1, pallet4 is clear, crate0 is at distributor2, crate2 is clear, hoist4 is at distributor0, crate0 is clear, hoist1 is available, crate0 is on pallet6, crate1 is clear, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist4 is available, hoist5 is available, crate3 is clear, hoist3 is available, hoist6 is at distributor2, pallet4 is at distributor0, pallet5 is at distributor1 and pallet2 is at depot2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot1 to depot0 to reach the current state.

"prompt": "A surface can be a pallet or a crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, pallet1 is clear, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is at depot3, crate2 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot3, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is on pallet5, truck2 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, crate3 is at distributor1, hoist6 is available, pallet6 is at distributor2, pallet2 is clear, hoist0 is available, crate2 is on pallet0, truck1 is at distributor0, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, crate1 is on pallet3, pallet3 is at depot3, truck0 is at depot1, hoist5 is at distributor1, pallet4 is clear, crate0 is at distributor2, crate2 is clear, hoist4 is at distributor0, crate0 is clear, hoist1 is available, crate0 is on pallet6, crate1 is clear, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist4 is available, hoist5 is available, crate3 is clear, hoist3 is available, hoist6 is at distributor2, pallet4 is at distributor0, pallet5 is at distributor1 and pallet2 is at depot2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot1 to depot0 to reach the current state.

Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, pallet1 is clear, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is at depot3, crate2 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot3, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is on pallet5, truck2 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, crate3 is at distributor1, hoist6 is available, pallet6 is at distributor2, pallet2 is clear, hoist0 is available, crate2 is on pallet0, truck1 is at distributor0, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, crate1 is on pallet3, pallet3 is at depot3, truck0 is at depot1, hoist5 is at distributor1, pallet4 is clear, crate0 is at distributor2, crate2 is clear, hoist4 is at distributor0, crate0 is clear, hoist1 is available, crate0 is on pallet6, crate1 is clear, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist4 is available, hoist5 is available, crate3 is clear, hoist3 is available, hoist6 is at distributor2, pallet4 is at distributor0, pallet5 is at distributor1 and pallet2 is at depot2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot1 to depot0 to reach the current state.

"prompt": "A surface can be a pallet or a crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, pallet1 is clear, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is at depot3, crate2 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot3, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is on pallet5, truck2 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, crate3 is at distributor1, hoist6 is available, pallet6 is at distributor2, pallet2 is clear, hoist0 is available, crate2 is on pallet0, truck1 is at distributor0, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, crate1 is on pallet3, pallet3 is at depot3, truck0 is at depot1, hoist5 is at distributor1, pallet4 is clear, crate0 is at distributor2, crate2 is clear, hoist4 is at distributor0, crate0 is clear, hoist1 is available, crate0 is on pallet6, crate1 is clear, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist4 is available, hoist5 is available, crate3 is clear, hoist3 is available, hoist6 is at distributor2, pallet4 is at distributor0, pallet5 is at distributor1 and pallet2 is at depot2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot1 to depot0 to reach the current state.

Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck.

Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, pallet1 is clear, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is at depot3, crate2 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot3, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is on pallet5, truck2 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, crate3 is at distributor1, hoist6 is available, pallet6 is at distributor2, pallet2 is clear, hoist0 is available, crate2 is on pallet0, truck1 is at distributor0, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, crate1 is on pallet3, pallet3 is at depot3, truck0 is at depot1, hoist5 is at distributor1, pallet4 is clear, crate0 is at distributor2, crate2 is clear, hoist4 is at distributor0, crate0 is clear, hoist1 is available, crate0 is on pallet6, crate1 is clear, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist4 is available, hoist5 is available, crate3 is clear, hoist3 is available, hoist6 is at distributor2, pallet4 is at distributor0, pallet5 is at distributor1 and pallet2 is at depot2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot1 to depot0, hoist0 lifts crate2 from pallet0 at depot0, crate2 is loaded by hoist0 into truck2 at depot0, truck2 is driven from depot0 to distributor1 and hoist3 lifts crate1 from pallet3 at depot3 to reach the current state.

crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, pallet1 is clear, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is at depot3, crate2 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot3, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is on pallet5, truck2 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, crate3 is at distributor1, hoist6 is available, pallet6 is at distributor2, pallet2 is clear, hoist0 is available, crate2 is on pallet0, truck1 is at distributor0, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, crate1 is on pallet3, pallet3 is at depot3, truck0 is at depot1, hoist5 is at distributor1, pallet4 is clear, crate0 is at distributor2, crate2 is clear, hoist4 is at distributor0, crate0 is clear, hoist1 is available, crate0 is on pallet6, crate1 is clear, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist4 is available, hoist5 is available, crate3 is clear, hoist3 is available, hoist6 is at distributor2, pallet4 is at distributor0, pallet5 is at distributor1 and pallet2 is at depot2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot1 to depot0, hoist0 lifts crate2 from pallet0 at depot0, crate2 is loaded by hoist0 into truck2 at depot0, truck2 is driven from depot0 to distributor1 and hoist3 lifts crate1 from pallet3 at depot3 to reach the current state.

crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, pallet1 is clear, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is at depot3, crate2 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot3, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is on pallet5, truck2 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, crate3 is at distributor1, hoist6 is available, pallet6 is at distributor2, pallet2 is clear, hoist0 is available, crate2 is on pallet0, truck1 is at distributor0, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, crate1 is on pallet3, pallet3 is at depot3, truck0 is at depot1, hoist5 is at distributor1, pallet4 is clear, crate0 is at distributor2, crate2 is clear, hoist4 is at distributor0, crate0 is clear, hoist1 is available, crate0 is on pallet6, crate1 is clear, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist4 is available, hoist5 is available, crate3 is clear, hoist3 is available, hoist6 is at distributor2, pallet4 is at distributor0, pallet5 is at distributor1 and pallet2 is at depot2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot1 to depot0, hoist0 lifts crate2 from pallet0 at depot0, crate2 is loaded by hoist0 into truck2 at depot0, truck2 is driven from depot0 to distributor1 and hoist3 lifts crate1 from pallet3 at depot3 to reach the current state.

Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate.

crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck.

crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, pallet1 is clear, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is at depot3, crate2 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot3, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is on pallet5, truck2 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, crate3 is at distributor1, hoist6 is available, pallet6 is at distributor2, pallet2 is clear, hoist0 is available, crate2 is on pallet0, truck1 is at distributor0, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, crate1 is on pallet3, pallet3 is at depot3, truck0 is at depot1, hoist5 is at distributor1, pallet4 is clear, crate0 is at distributor2, crate2 is clear, hoist4 is at distributor0, crate0 is clear, hoist1 is available, crate0 is on pallet6, crate1 is clear, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist4 is available, hoist5 is available, crate3 is clear, hoist3 is available, hoist6 is at distributor2, pallet4 is at distributor0, pallet5 is at distributor1 and pallet2 is at depot2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot1 to depot0, hoist0 lifts crate2 from pallet0 at depot0, crate2 is loaded by hoist0 into truck2 at depot0, truck2 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, hoist3 lifts crate1 from pallet3 at depot3, hoist5 lifts crate3 from pallet5 at distributor1, crate3 is loaded by hoist5 into truck2 at distributor1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist5 from truck2 at distributor1, truck2 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2 and hoist5 drops crate2 on pallet5 at distributor1 to reach the current state.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination and not at the starting location. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate and not available.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, pallet1 is clear, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is at depot3, crate2 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot3, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is on pallet5, truck2 is at depot1, pallet0 is at depot0, crate3 is at distributor1, hoist6 is available, pallet6 is at distributor2, pallet2 is clear, hoist0 is available, crate2 is on pallet0, truck1 is at distributor0, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, crate1 is on pallet3, pallet3 is at depot3, truck0 is at depot1, hoist5 is at distributor1, pallet4 is clear, crate0 is at distributor2, crate2 is clear, hoist4 is at distributor0, crate0 is clear, hoist1 is available, crate0 is on pallet6, crate1 is clear, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist4 is available, hoist5 is available, crate3 is clear, hoist3 is available, hoist6 is at distributor2, pallet4 is at distributor0, pallet5 is at distributor1 and pallet2 is at depot2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot1 to depot0, hoist0 lifts crate2 from pallet0 at depot0, crate2 is loaded by hoist0 into truck2 at depot0, truck2 is driven from depot0 to distributor1, hoist3 lifts crate1 from pallet3 at depot3, hoist5 lifts crate3 from pallet5 at distributor1, crate3 is loaded by hoist5 into truck2 at distributor1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist5 from truck2 at distributor1, truck2 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2 and hoist5 drops crate2 on pallet5 at distributor1 to reach the current state. In this state, list all valid properties of the state that involve negations that involve hoist0. Write None if there are none.\n\n[ANSWER]:\n", "response": "- hoist0 is not lifting a crate\n- hoist0 is not available"}

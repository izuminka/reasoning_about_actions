Loading the package onto the truck causes the package not to be at that location but to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to not be at the location but in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be not in the truck anymore, but be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in a location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location and not in the plane anymore. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination and not at the source. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be not at the source location but at the destination location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p1 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l2_0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, object p4 is at airport l0_0, object p5 is at airport l1_0, object p3 is at airport l2_0, object t0 is at airport l0_0, object p0 is at airport l1_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_1 is in city c0, airport l0_0 is in city c0, object t1 is at airport l1_1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, airport l2_1 is in city c2, airport l2_0 is in city c2 and object t2 is at airport l2_0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l2_0 to airport l1_0, package p5 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p2 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p0 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l1_0 to airport l0_0, package p5 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l0_0, package p5 is loaded in truck t0 at airport l0_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_0 to airport l0_1 in city c0, package p5 is unloaded from truck t0 at airport l0_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t0 at airport l0_1, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0 and package p1 is unloaded from truck t0 at airport l0_0 to reach the current state.

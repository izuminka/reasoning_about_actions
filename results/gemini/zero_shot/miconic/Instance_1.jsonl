Boarding the lift causes the passenger to be boarded. Departing from the lift is executable only when the lift is on the floor, the passenger is boarded, and the passenger's destination is on that floor. Departing from the lift causes the passenger to be served and not boarded. A lift can go up from one floor to another if and only if it is currently on the floor and the destination floor is above the source floor. Going up makes the lift on the destination floor. A lift can go down from one floor to another if and only if it is currently on a floor and the source floor is above the destination floor. Going down makes the lift on the destination floor.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, destination of passenger p3 is floor f0, destination of passenger p2 is floor f6, destination of passenger p4 is floor f3, floor f1 is above floor f0, floor f2 is above floor f1, floor f6 is above floor f5, floor f6 is above floor f1, passenger p7 enters at floor f5, passenger p4 enters at floor f4, floor f5 is above floor f4, destination of passenger p5 is floor f3, passenger p5 enters at floor f5, passenger p3 enters at floor f2, floor f6 is above floor f4, floor f6 is above floor f0, floor f5 is above floor f1, floor f6 is above floor f2, destination of passenger p0 is floor f5, passenger p1 enters at floor f0, destination of passenger p1 is floor f2, floor f3 is above floor f2, passenger p2 enters at floor f2, floor f4 is above floor f3, floor f4 is above floor f0, floor f4 is above floor f1, passenger p0 enters at floor f0, floor f5 is above floor f2, destination of passenger p7 is floor f3, passenger p6 enters at floor f1, floor f3 is above floor f1, floor f2 is above floor f0, passenger p8 enters at floor f6, passenger p9 enters at floor f0, floor f3 is above floor f0, floor f5 is above floor f0, floor f4 is above floor f2, destination of passenger p9 is floor f5, floor f5 is above floor f3, floor f6 is above floor f3, lift is at floor f0, destination of passenger p8 is floor f2 and destination of passenger p6 is floor f3\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are planned to be performed: passenger p0 boards at floor f0, passenger p1 boards at floor f0, passenger p9 boards at floor f0, the elevator goes up from floor f0 to floor f1, passenger p6 boards at floor f2, the elevator goes up from floor f1 to floor f2, passenger p2 boards at floor f2, passenger p3 boards at floor f2, the elevator goes down from floor f2 to floor f0, passenger p3 departs at floor f0, the elevator goes up from floor f0 to floor f4, passenger p4 boards at floor f4, the elevator goes up from floor f4 to floor f5, passenger p5 boards at floor f5, passenger p7 boards at floor f5, passenger p9 departs at floor f5, passenger p0 departs at floor f5, the elevator goes down from floor f5 to floor f3 and passenger p7 departs at floor f3. Is it possible to execute it, True or False?\n\n[ANSWER]:\n", "response": "True"}

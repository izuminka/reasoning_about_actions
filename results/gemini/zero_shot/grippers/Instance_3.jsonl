Dropping the object in a specified room is only executable when the robot is carrying that object using its gripper, and the robot is in the said room. Dropping an object in a room makes the object be in that room, the gripper be free and the robot not carrying the object anymore.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, ball6 is at room1, ball4 is at room2, ball1 is at room1, ball3 is at room1, rgripper1 of robot1 is free, robot1 is at room4, ball2 is at room2, lgripper1 of robot1 is free, ball5 is at room3 and ball7 is at room4\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: ball7 is picked from room4 with lgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room4 to room5, ball7 is dropped in room5 with lgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room5 to room1, ball1 is picked from room1 with lgripper1 by robot1, ball3 is picked from room1 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room1 to room5, ball1 is dropped in room5 with lgripper1 by robot1, ball3 is dropped in room5 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room5 to room2, ball2 is picked from room2 with lgripper1 by robot1, ball4 is picked from room2 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room2 to room1, ball4 is dropped in room1 with rgripper1 by robot1 and ball6 is picked from room1 with rgripper1 by robot1 to reach the current state.

Moving the robot causes it to be not in the said room but in the destination room. A robot can pick up the object using a gripper only when the object and the robot are in the same room and the mentioned gripper is free. Picking up the object causes the robot to carry that object using its gripper, the object to be not in that room, and the said gripper not free. Dropping the object in a specified room is only executable when the robot is carrying that object using its gripper, and the robot is in the said room. Dropping an object in a room makes the object be in that room, the gripper be free and the robot not carrying the object anymore.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, ball6 is at room1, ball4 is at room2, ball1 is at room1, ball3 is at room1, rgripper1 of robot1 is free, robot1 is at room4, ball2 is at room2, lgripper1 of robot1 is free, ball5 is at room3 and ball7 is at room4\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: ball7 is picked from room4 with lgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room4 to room5, ball7 is dropped in room5 with lgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room5 to room1 and ball1 is picked from room1 with lgripper1 by robot1 to reach the current state.

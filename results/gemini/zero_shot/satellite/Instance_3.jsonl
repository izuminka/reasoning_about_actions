Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to power on but not calibrated. Switching on the instrument causes the satellite to not have power available.  Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to power off, and causes the satellite to have power available. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction, it also causes the satellite to not point at the source direction. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to power on but not calibrated. Switching on the instrument causes the satellite to not have power available.  Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to power off, and causes the satellite to have power available. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction, it also causes the satellite to not point at the source direction. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to power on but not calibrated. Switching on the instrument causes the satellite to not have power available.  Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to power off, and causes the satellite to have power available. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction, it also causes the satellite to not point at the source direction. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to power on but not calibrated. Switching on the instrument causes the satellite to not have power available.  Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to power off, and causes the satellite to have power available. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction, it also causes the satellite to not point at the source direction. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to power on but not calibrated. Switching on the instrument causes the satellite to not have power available.  Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to power off, and causes the satellite to have power available. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction, it also causes the satellite to not point at the source direction. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to power on but not calibrated. Switching on the instrument causes the satellite to not have power available.  Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to power off, and causes the satellite to have power available. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation9, satellite0 is pointing to star1, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation4, satellite1 is pointing to groundstation4, instrument2 supports spectrograph0, instrument2 supports infrared3, instrument0 is calibrated for star0, instrument0 supports thermograph4, instrument0 supports spectrograph0, instrument1 is calibrated for star8, instrument1 supports spectrograph1, instrument1 supports spectrograph0, instrument3 supports spectrograph2, satellite0 has power available, instrument2 supports spectrograph2, instrument3 is calibrated for star6, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is on board satellite1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation2, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation4, instrument3 supports spectrograph1, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation4, instrument2 is calibrated for star7, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation2 and instrument2 is on board satellite1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument3 on satellite1 is switched on to reach the current state.

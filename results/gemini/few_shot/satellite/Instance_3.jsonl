source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction, it also causes the satellite to not point at the source direction. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to power on but not calibrated. Switching on the instrument causes the satellite to not have power available.  Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to power off, and causes the satellite to have power available. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument1 supports thermograph4, instrument1 is calibrated for star0, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation7, instrument0 supports thermograph4, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation5, instrument3 is on board satellite2, instrument1 is on board satellite1, instrument4 supports infrared0, instrument0 supports infrared2, instrument0 is calibrated for star0, satellite2 is pointing to star10, instrument2 is calibrated for star0, instrument2 supports spectrograph1, satellite1 has power available, instrument2 is on board satellite1, instrument3 supports thermograph4, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 supports thermograph4, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation5, satellite1 is pointing to star11, instrument4 is on board satellite2, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation6, instrument3 is calibrated for star0, instrument4 supports thermograph4, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation7, satellite2 has power available, instrument0 supports image3 and satellite0 has power available\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument4 on satellite2 is switched on to reach the current state.

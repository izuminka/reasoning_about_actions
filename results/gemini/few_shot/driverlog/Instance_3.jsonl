Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a link between location s1 and location s3, there is a path between location s0 and location p3_0, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, truck1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s0, package4 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_3, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_0, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s1, driver2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s2, truck2 is empty, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, truck2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s1, there is a path between location s3 and location p3_0, driver3 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s3 and location p2_3, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s2, there is a path between location s0 and location p2_0, truck1 is empty, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s3, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s3, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s3, driver1 is at loaction s0 and there is a path between location s2 and location p1_2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver2 boards truck1 at location s2 to reach the current state.

object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a link between location s1 and location s3, there is a path between location s0 and location p3_0, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, truck1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s0, package4 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_3, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_0, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s1, driver2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s2, truck2 is empty, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, truck2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s1, there is a path between location s3 and location p3_0, driver3 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s3 and location p2_3, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s2, there is a path between location s0 and location p2_0, truck1 is empty, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s3, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s3, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s3, driver1 is at loaction s0 and there is a path between location s2 and location p1_2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver2 boards truck1 at location s2 to reach the current state.

object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a link between location s1 and location s3, there is a path between location s0 and location p3_0, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, truck1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s0, package4 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_3, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_0, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s1, driver2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s2, truck2 is empty, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, truck2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s1, there is a path between location s3 and location p3_0, driver3 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s3 and location p2_3, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s2, there is a path between location s0 and location p2_0, truck1 is empty, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s3, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s3, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s3, driver1 is at loaction s0 and there is a path between location s2 and location p1_2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver2 boards truck1 at location s2, s2 drives truck1 from location s3 to location driver2, load package3 in truck1 at location s3, s3 drives truck1 from location s1 to location driver2 and driver2 disembarks from truck1 at location s1 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a link between location s1 and location s3, there is a path between location s0 and location p3_0, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, truck1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s0, package4 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_3, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_0, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s1, driver2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s2, truck2 is empty, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, truck2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s1, there is a path between location s3 and location p3_0, driver3 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s3 and location p2_3, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s2, there is a path between location s0 and location p2_0, truck1 is empty, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s3, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s3, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s3, driver1 is at loaction s0 and there is a path between location s2 and location p1_2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver2 boards truck1 at location s2, s2 drives truck1 from location s3 to location driver2, load package3 in truck1 at location s3, s3 drives truck1 from location s1 to location driver2 and driver2 disembarks from truck1 at location s1 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty.

Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a link between location s1 and location s3, there is a path between location s0 and location p3_0, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, truck1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s0, package4 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_3, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_0, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s1, driver2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s2, truck2 is empty, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, truck2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s1, there is a path between location s3 and location p3_0, driver3 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s3 and location p2_3, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s2, there is a path between location s0 and location p2_0, truck1 is empty, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s3, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s3, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s3, driver1 is at loaction s0 and there is a path between location s2 and location p1_2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver2 boards truck1 at location s2, s2 drives truck1 from location s3 to location driver2, load package3 in truck1 at location s3, s3 drives truck1 from location s1 to location driver2, driver2 disembarks from truck1 at location s1, unload package3 from truck1 at location s1, load package4 in truck2 at location s2, load package2 in truck2 at location s2, load package1 in truck2 at location s2 and driver1 walks from location s0 to location p2_0 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a link between location s1 and location s3, there is a path between location s0 and location p3_0, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, truck1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s0, package4 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_3, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_0, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s1, driver2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s2, truck2 is empty, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, truck2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s1, there is a path between location s3 and location p3_0, driver3 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s3 and location p2_3, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s2, there is a path between location s0 and location p2_0, truck1 is empty, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s3, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s3, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s3, driver1 is at loaction s0 and there is a path between location s2 and location p1_2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver2 boards truck1 at location s2 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a link between location s1 and location s3, there is a path between location s0 and location p3_0, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, truck1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s0, package4 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_3, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_0, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s1, driver2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s2, truck2 is empty, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, truck2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s1, there is a path between location s3 and location p3_0, driver3 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s3 and location p2_3, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s2, there is a path between location s0 and location p2_0, truck1 is empty, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s3, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s3, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s3, driver1 is at loaction s0 and there is a path between location s2 and location p1_2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver2 boards truck1 at location s2 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a link between location s1 and location s3, there is a path between location s0 and location p3_0, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, truck1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s0, package4 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_3, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_0, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s1, driver2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s2, truck2 is empty, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, truck2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s1, there is a path between location s3 and location p3_0, driver3 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s3 and location p2_3, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s2, there is a path between location s0 and location p2_0, truck1 is empty, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s3, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s3, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s3, driver1 is at loaction s0 and there is a path between location s2 and location p1_2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver2 boards truck1 at location s2 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a link between location s1 and location s3, there is a path between location s0 and location p3_0, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, truck1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s0, package4 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_3, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_0, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s1, driver2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s2, truck2 is empty, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, truck2 is at loaction s2, there is a link between location s3 and location s1, there is a path between location s3 and location p3_0, driver3 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s3 and location p2_3, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s2, there is a path between location s0 and location p2_0, truck1 is empty, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s3, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s3, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p2_3 and location s3, driver1 is at loaction s0 and there is a path between location s2 and location p1_2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver2 boards truck1 at location s2 to reach the current state.

Once picked up, the block is no longer on the table or clear, and the hand is no longer empty. To put a block down, it must be held, and doing so places it on the table, making it clear and leaving the hand becomes empty. A block can be stacked on another if it is held and the other block is clear, which results in the stacked block becoming clear and the second block no longer clear, with the hand becoming empty. Conversely, unstacking requires the hand to be empty and the first block to be clear and on top of the second block. After unstacking, the second block becomes clear, while the first block is held, no longer clear, and no longer on top of the second block, leaving the hand not empty.\\n\\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\\nInitially, Block b1 is stacked on block b7, block b2 has no blocks on top of it, block b2 is stacked on block b6, block b3 is placed on top of block b4, block b4 is positioned on the table, block b5 has no blocks on top of it, block b5 is also on the table, block b6 is stacked on block b3, block b7 is resting on the table, block b8 is on top of block b1, block b9 has no blocks on top of it, block b9 is stacked on block b8, and the hand is empty.\\n\\n[QUESTION]\\nGiven the initial state, the following actions are scheduled to be executed: block b9 is removed from the top of block b8, block b9 is placed down, block b2 is removed from the top of block b6, block b2 is stacked on top of block b5, block b8 is removed from the top of block b9, the hand places block b6 down, block b3 is removed from block b4, block b3 is stacked on top of block b9, block b8 is removed from the top of block b1, block b8 is stacked on top of block b4, block b2 is removed from block b5, block b2 is stacked on top of block b8, block b3 is removed from block b9, block b3 is stacked on top of block b2, block b1 is removed from block b7, block b1 is stacked on top of block b3, block b7 is picked up by the hand, block b7 is stacked on top of block b9, and block b6 is picked up to reach the current state.

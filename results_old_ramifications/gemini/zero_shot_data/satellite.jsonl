Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite.

Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument3 supports image0, instrument2 supports image3, instrument0 supports image3, instrument0 is calibrated for star1, instrument3 is calibrated for star8, satellite1 is pointing to phenomenon10, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation7, instrument3 is on board satellite1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, satellite0 has power available, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation3, instrument3 supports image2, instrument2 supports image2, instrument3 supports image3, instrument2 is calibrated for star9, instrument0 supports infrared1, instrument3 is calibrated for star6, instrument1 supports image3, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument1 supports infrared1, instrument2 is on board satellite0, satellite1 has power available, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation5, instrument0 is calibrated for star9, instrument1 supports image0 and instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation5\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument3 on satellite1 is switched on to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument3 supports image0, instrument2 supports image3, instrument0 supports image3, instrument0 is calibrated for star1, instrument3 is calibrated for star8, satellite1 is pointing to phenomenon10, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation7, instrument3 is on board satellite1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, satellite0 has power available, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation3, instrument3 supports image2, instrument2 supports image2, instrument3 supports image3, instrument2 is calibrated for star9, instrument0 supports infrared1, instrument3 is calibrated for star6, instrument1 supports image3, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument1 supports infrared1, instrument2 is on board satellite0, satellite1 has power available, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation5, instrument0 is calibrated for star9, instrument1 supports image0 and instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation5\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument3 on satellite1 is switched on, instrument0 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite1 turns to groundstation5 from phenomenon10, instrument3 is calibrated on satellite1 to groundstation5, satellite1 turns to phenomenon16 from groundstation5, image of phenomenon16 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image3, satellite1 turns to phenomenon17 from phenomenon16, image of phenomenon17 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image3, satellite1 turns to planet11 from phenomenon17, image of planet11 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image3, satellite1 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image0, satellite1 turns to planet14 from planet13, image of planet14 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image0 and satellite1 turns to star15 from planet14 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power.

Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument3 supports image0, instrument2 supports image3, instrument0 supports image3, instrument0 is calibrated for star1, instrument3 is calibrated for star8, satellite1 is pointing to phenomenon10, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation7, instrument3 is on board satellite1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, satellite0 has power available, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation3, instrument3 supports image2, instrument2 supports image2, instrument3 supports image3, instrument2 is calibrated for star9, instrument0 supports infrared1, instrument3 is calibrated for star6, instrument1 supports image3, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument1 supports infrared1, instrument2 is on board satellite0, satellite1 has power available, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation5, instrument0 is calibrated for star9, instrument1 supports image0 and instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation5\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are planned to be performed: instrument3 on satellite1 is switched on, instrument0 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite1 turns to groundstation5 from phenomenon10, instrument3 is calibrated on satellite1 to groundstation5, satellite1 turns to phenomenon16 from groundstation5, image of phenomenon16 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image3, satellite1 turns to phenomenon17 from phenomenon16, image of phenomenon17 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image3, satellite1 turns to planet11 from phenomenon17 and image of planet11 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image3.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on.

Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument3 supports image0, instrument2 supports image3, instrument0 supports image3, instrument0 is calibrated for star1, instrument3 is calibrated for star8, satellite1 is pointing to phenomenon10, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation7, instrument3 is on board satellite1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, satellite0 has power available, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation3, instrument3 supports image2, instrument2 supports image2, instrument3 supports image3, instrument2 is calibrated for star9, instrument0 supports infrared1, instrument3 is calibrated for star6, instrument1 supports image3, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument1 supports infrared1, instrument2 is on board satellite0, satellite1 has power available, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument2 is calibrated for groundstation5, instrument0 is calibrated for star9, instrument1 supports image0 and instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation5\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are planned to be performed: instrument3 on satellite1 is switched on, instrument0 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite1 turns to groundstation5 from phenomenon10, instrument3 is calibrated on satellite1 to groundstation5, satellite1 turns to phenomenon16 from groundstation5, image of phenomenon16 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image3, satellite1 turns to phenomenon17 from phenomenon16, image of phenomenon17 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image3, satellite1 turns to planet11 from phenomenon17, image of planet11 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image3, satellite1 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image0, satellite1 turns to planet14 from planet13, image of planet14 is taken with instrument3 on satellite1 in image0 and satellite1 turns to star15 from planet14.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

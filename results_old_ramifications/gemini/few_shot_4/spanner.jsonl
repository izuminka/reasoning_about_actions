Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location.

Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose.

Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time.

Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

"Walking from start location to destination location is executable if the man is at the start location initially and there is a link between start and the destination location. Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

location initially and there is a link between start and the destination location. Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened. The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, spanner5 is at location6, nut1 is loose, nut2 is at gate, spanner2 is usable, spanner1 is at location8, nut3 is at gate, location4 is linked to location5, spanner5 is usable, bob is at shed, location1 is linked to location2, location6 is linked to location7, nut4 is at gate, spanner3 is at location2, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is usable, spanner4 is at location2, location3 is linked to location4, location7 is linked to location8, location8 is linked to location9, location9 is linked to gate, location2 is linked to location3, nut1 is at gate, location5 is linked to location6, spanner2 is at location6, nut5 is loose, nut3 is loose, nut4 is loose, spanner4 is usable, shed is linked to location1, spanner1 is usable and nut5 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob walks from shed to location1 to reach the current state.

location l1 that has fuel level f6 and f5, so location l1 does not have fuel f6.\n- cargo c1 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, so vehicle v0 has space s1.\n- vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f7 and f6, so location l0 does not have fuel f7.\n- cargo c4 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, so cargo c4 is not at location l1 and vehicle v0 has space s0.\n- vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f5 and f4, so location l1 does not have fuel f5.\n- cargo c4 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, so vehicle v0 has space s1.\n- vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f6 and f5, so location l0 does not have fuel f6.\n- cargo c6 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, so cargo c6 is not at location l1 and vehicle v0 has space s0.\n- vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f4 and f3, so location l1 does not have fuel f4.\n- cargo c6 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, so vehicle v0 has space s1.\n- vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f5 and f4, so location l0 does not have fuel f5.\n- cargo c7 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, so cargo c7 is not at location l1 and vehicle v0 has space s0.\n- vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f3 and f2, so location l1 does not have fuel f3.\n- cargo c7 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, so vehicle v0 has space s1.\n- vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f4 and f3, so location l0 does not have fuel f4.\n- cargo c8 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, so cargo c8 is not at location l1 and vehicle v0 has space s0.\n- vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f2 and f1 and cargo c8 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, so location l1 does not have fuel f2 and vehicle v0 has space

This means that the fuel level at location l1 is now f5.\n\nSecondly, the vehicle v0 unloads cargo c1 at location l0, which means that cargo c1 is now at location l0.\n\nThirdly, the vehicle v0 moves from location l0 to location l1 with fuel level f7 and f6. This means that the fuel level at location l0 is now f7.\nThen, the vehicle v0 loads cargo c4 at location l1, which means that cargo c4 is now in vehicle v0.\n\nFifthly, the vehicle v0 moves from location l1 to location l0 with fuel level f5 and f4. This means that the fuel level at location l1 is now f4.\n\nSixthly, the vehicle v0 unloads cargo c4 at location l0, which means that cargo c4 is now at location l0 as well.\n\nSeventhly, the vehicle v0 moves from location l0 to location l1 with fuel level f6 and f5. This means that the fuel level at location l0 is now f5.\n\nFinally, the vehicle v0 loads cargo c6 at location l1, which means that cargo c6 is now in vehicle v0, and the vehicle v0 moves from location l1 to location l0 with fuel level f4 and f3.

is executable if the vehicle is at source location, there is a connection between the source location and destination location, and the location\u2019s fuel level has some neighboring level. Moving a vehicle from source location to destination location causes the vehicle to be present at the destination location and decreases the location\u2019s fuel level to its next level. A cargo can be loaded onto a vehicle if the cargo and the vehicle are at the same location and the vehicle has some space. When a cargo is loaded into the vehicle, it is in the vehicle. It also decreases the vehicle\u2019s space to its next level. A cargo can be unloaded from a vehicle if the cargo is in the vehicle. When a cargo is unloaded from the vehicle, it is at the same location as that of the vehicle. It also increases the vehicle\u2019s space to its next higher level.

When a cargo is unloaded from the vehicle, it is at the same location as that of the vehicle. It also increases the vehicle\u2019s space to its next higher level. Vehicle can only be at one location at a time. Cargo can only be at one place at a time. The location\u2019s fuel level is unique. The vehicle\u2019s amount of space is unique. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level f6 neighbours fuel level f7, space s0 neighbours space s1, cargo c6 is at location l1, cargo c7 is at location l1, cargo c0 is at location l1, location l0 has fuel f5, cargo c4 is at location l1, vehicle v0 has space s1, fuel level f2 neighbours fuel level f3, location l0 is connected to location l1, cargo c2 is at location l1, vehicle v1 has space s1, location l1 has fuel f7, cargo c1 is at location l1, fuel level f4 neighbours fuel level f5, fuel level f0 neighbours fuel level f1, fuel level f5 neighbours fuel level f6, fuel level f1 neighbours fuel level f2, fuel level f3 neighbours fuel level f4, cargo v0 is at location l0, cargo c8 is at location l0, location l1 is connected to location l0, cargo v1 is at location l1, cargo c5 is at location l0 and cargo c3 is at location l0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c0 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f7 and f6, cargo c0 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f4 and f3, cargo c1 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f6 and f5, cargo c1 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f3 and f2, cargo c2 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c2 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f2 and f1, cargo c4 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f4 and f3, cargo c4 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f1 and f0, cargo c6 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1 and vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f3 and f2 to reach the current state.

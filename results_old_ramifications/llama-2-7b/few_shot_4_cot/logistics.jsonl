Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

Based on the examples provided earlier, I will explain why the answer is False.\n\nIn the question, it is stated that package p0 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_2 to reach the current state. However, the initial conditions provided earlier show that object p2 is at airport l0_2, which is in city c0. This means that truck t1 cannot be at airport l1_2, as it is not possible to load a package in a truck that is not present at the location. Therefore, the statement that package p0 is in vehicle t1 is false.\n\nAdditionally, the question asks if all of the following properties are true in the current state: object p2 is at airport l0_2, airport l0_2 is in city c0, object t2 is at airport l0_1, object t1 is at airport l1_2, object a0 is at airport l1_0, airport l1_0 is in city c1, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, object t0 is at airport l0_2, package p0 is in vehicle t1, airport l0_1 is in city c0, object a1 is at airport l1_0, object p3 is at airport l0_2, object p1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l1_2 is in city c1.\n\nHowever, we have already established that package p0 is not in vehicle t1, so the statement that package p0 is in vehicle t1 is false.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

"Loading a package onto a truck is only possible if both the package and the truck are in the same location. Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

"Loading a package onto a truck is only possible if both the package and the truck are in the same location. Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time. A plane can only be in one location at a time.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l0_0 to airport l1_0, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0 and package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0 to reach the current state.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time. A plane can only be in one location at a time.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l0_0 to airport l1_0, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_0 to airport l1_1 in city c1, package p3 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p2 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p1 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0 and airplane a0 is flown from airport l1_0 to airport l0_0 to reach the current state.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time. A plane can only be in one location at a time.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l0_0 to airport l1_0, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_0 to airport l1_1 in city c1, package p3 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p2 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p1 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0 and airplane a0 is flown from airport l1_0 to airport l0_0 to reach the current state.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

"Loading a package onto a truck is only possible if both the package and the truck are in the same location. Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time. A plane can only be in one location at a time.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1 to reach the current state.

To answer your question, we need to analyze the given initial conditions and the actions that can be performed based on them.\n\nFrom the initial conditions, we have:\n\n* Object p2 is at airport l0_2 in city c0.\n* Object t2 is at airport l0_1 in city c0.\n* Object t1 is at airport l1_2 in city c1.\n* Object a0 is at airport l1_0 in city c1.\n* Airports l0_0, l0_1, and l1_0 are in city c0.\n* Airports l1_1 and l1_2 are in city c1.\n* Object p0 is at airport l1_2.\n* Object p1 is at airport l1_1.\n* Object p3 is at airport l0_2.\n\nNow, let's think about the actions that can be performed based on these initial conditions:\n\n1. Loading package p0 in truck t1 at airport l1_2: This action is not possible because airport l1_2 is not in the same location as truck t1.\n2. Unloading package p0 from truck t1 at airport l1_2: This action is not possible because airport l1_2 is not in the same location as truck t1.\n3. Loading package p1 in truck t1 at airport l1_2: This action is not possible because airport l1_2 is not in the same location as truck t1.\n4. Unloading package p1 from truck t1 at airport l1_2: This action is not possible because airport l1_2 is not in the same location as truck t1.\n5. Loading package p3 in truck t1 at airport l0_2: This action is possible because airport l0_2 is in the same location as truck t1.\n6. Unloading package p3 from truck t1 at airport l0_2: This action is possible because airport l0_2 is in the same location as truck t1.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the only executable action is to load package p3 in truck t1 at airport l0_2. Therefore, the answer is \"loading package p3 in truck t1 at airport l0_2\"."}

By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear.

By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block. Furthermore, the hand is not empty.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, block b7 is on the table, block b5 is on the table, block b2 is clear, block b3 is on block b4, block b1 is on block b7, hand is empty, block b9 is clear, block b4 is on the table, block b6 is on block b3, block b5 is clear, block b8 is on block b1, block b9 is on block b8 and block b2 is on block b6\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: block b9 is unstacked from block b8, block b9 is put down, block b2 is unstacked from block b6, block b2 is stacked on top block b5 and block b6 is unstacked from block b3 to reach the current state.

By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block.

The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block.

The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block. Furthermore, the hand is not empty.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, block b7 is on the table, block b5 is on the table, block b2 is clear, block b3 is on block b4, block b1 is on block b7, hand is empty, block b9 is clear, block b4 is on the table, block b6 is on block b3, block b5 is clear, block b8 is on block b1, block b9 is on block b8 and block b2 is on block b6\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: block b9 is unstacked from block b8, block b9 is put down, block b2 is unstacked from block b6, block b2 is stacked on top block b5 and block b6 is unstacked from block b3 to reach the current state.

The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block.

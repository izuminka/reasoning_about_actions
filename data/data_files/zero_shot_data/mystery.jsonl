As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it. When a vehicle is unloaded, cargo is no longer in the vehicle, cargo is at a location, the vehicle no longer has the initial space, and there is a secondary space.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level f4 neighbours fuel level f5, cargo c1 is at location l1, space s0 neighbours space s1, cargo c5 is at location l1, fuel level f7 neighbours fuel level f8, cargo c3 is at location l0, fuel level f5 neighbours fuel level f6, fuel level f6 neighbours fuel level f7, cargo c0 is at location l1, fuel level f1 neighbours fuel level f2, cargo c7 is at location l1, cargo c6 is at location l1, location l1 is connected to location l0, cargo c10 is at location l0, cargo v0 is at location l1, cargo c8 is at location l1, fuel level f3 neighbours fuel level f4, cargo c9 is at location l1, fuel level f2 neighbours fuel level f3, cargo c2 is at location l0, location l1 has fuel f6, vehicle v0 has space s1, fuel level f0 neighbours fuel level f1, cargo c4 is at location l1, location l0 has fuel f7 and location l0 is connected to location l1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: cargo c1 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f6 and f5, cargo c1 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f7 and f6, cargo c4 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c4 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f6 and f5, cargo c6 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f4 and f3, cargo c6 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0, vehicle v0 moves to location l1 from location l0 that has fuel level f5 and f4, cargo c7 is loaded in vehicle v0 with space s1 and space s0 at location l1, vehicle v0 moves to location l0 from location l1 that has fuel level f3 and f2 and cargo c7 is unloaded from vehicle v0 with space s0 and space s1 at location l0 to reach the current state.

As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

As a result, a vehicle is no longer at the original location, it is at the destination, there is no first set of fuel at the initial location, but a second set of fuel is present at the initial location. A vehicle can be loaded if cargo is at a location, the vehicle is at the same location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space in the vehicle. When cargo is loaded into the vehicle, cargo is no longer at a location, cargo is now in the vehicle, the first space in the vehicle is occupied, but the vehicle has a secondary space. A vehicle can be unloaded if the cargo is in the vehicle, the vehicle is at a location, the vehicle has space, and there is an additional space next to it.

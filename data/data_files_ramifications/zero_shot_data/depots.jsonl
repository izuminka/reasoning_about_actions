Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location. A crate can only be at one location. A crate can only be on top of one surface. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist2 is available, crate2 is at depot2, pallet2 is at depot2, crate1 is at depot2, pallet4 is at distributor1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist4 is at distributor1, pallet5 is clear, crate0 is at distributor0, hoist5 is at distributor2, truck1 is at depot1, crate0 is on pallet3, pallet0 is clear, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, pallet4 is clear, pallet5 is at distributor2, hoist3 is available, crate1 is on pallet2, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is at depot2, hoist5 is available, pallet1 is clear, crate0 is clear, hoist3 is at distributor0, truck2 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist1 is available, truck0 is at distributor0, crate2 is on crate1, crate3 is clear, hoist4 is available, hoist0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate2 and pallet3 is at distributor0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot0 to depot2, hoist2 lifts crate3 from crate2 at depot2, crate3 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate1 at depot2 and crate2 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2 to reach the current state.

Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location. A crate can only be at one location. A crate can only be on top of one surface. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist2 is available, crate2 is at depot2, pallet2 is at depot2, crate1 is at depot2, pallet4 is at distributor1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist4 is at distributor1, pallet5 is clear, crate0 is at distributor0, hoist5 is at distributor2, truck1 is at depot1, crate0 is on pallet3, pallet0 is clear, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, pallet4 is clear, pallet5 is at distributor2, hoist3 is available, crate1 is on pallet2, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is at depot2, hoist5 is available, pallet1 is clear, crate0 is clear, hoist3 is at distributor0, truck2 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist1 is available, truck0 is at distributor0, crate2 is on crate1, crate3 is clear, hoist4 is available, hoist0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate2 and pallet3 is at distributor0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot0 to depot2, hoist2 lifts crate3 from crate2 at depot2, crate3 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate1 at depot2 and crate2 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2 to reach the current state.

A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate).

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location.

Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location.

A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location. A crate can only be at one location. A crate can only be on top of one surface. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist2 is available, crate2 is at depot2, pallet2 is at depot2, crate1 is at depot2, pallet4 is at distributor1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist4 is at distributor1, pallet5 is clear, crate0 is at distributor0, hoist5 is at distributor2, truck1 is at depot1, crate0 is on pallet3, pallet0 is clear, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, pallet4 is clear, pallet5 is at distributor2, hoist3 is available, crate1 is on pallet2, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is at depot2, hoist5 is available, pallet1 is clear, crate0 is clear, hoist3 is at distributor0, truck2 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist1 is available, truck0 is at distributor0, crate2 is on crate1, crate3 is clear, hoist4 is available, hoist0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate2 and pallet3 is at distributor0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot0 to depot2, hoist2 lifts crate3 from crate2 at depot2, crate3 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate1 at depot2, crate2 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate1 from pallet2 at depot2, crate1 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, truck2 is driven from depot2 to distributor0, hoist3 lifts crate0 from pallet3 at distributor0, crate0 is loaded by hoist3 into truck2 at distributor0, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck2 at distributor0, truck2 is driven from distributor0 to distributor1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist4 from truck2 at distributor1, truck2 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2 and crate3 is unloaded by hoist5 from truck2 at distributor2 to reach the current state.

Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location. A crate can only be at one location. A crate can only be on top of one surface. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist2 is available, crate2 is at depot2, pallet2 is at depot2, crate1 is at depot2, pallet4 is at distributor1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist4 is at distributor1, pallet5 is clear, crate0 is at distributor0, hoist5 is at distributor2, truck1 is at depot1, crate0 is on pallet3, pallet0 is clear, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, pallet4 is clear, pallet5 is at distributor2, hoist3 is available, crate1 is on pallet2, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is at depot2, hoist5 is available, pallet1 is clear, crate0 is clear, hoist3 is at distributor0, truck2 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist1 is available, truck0 is at distributor0, crate2 is on crate1, crate3 is clear, hoist4 is available, hoist0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate2 and pallet3 is at distributor0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot0 to depot2, hoist2 lifts crate3 from crate2 at depot2, crate3 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate1 at depot2 and crate2 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2 to reach the current state.

crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location.

crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location.

crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location.

crate. A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location. Driving the truck makes the truck to be present at the final destination. A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location.

A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate).

A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location.

A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate).

A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location. A crate can only be at one location. A crate can only be on top of one surface. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist2 is available, crate2 is at depot2, pallet2 is at depot2, crate1 is at depot2, pallet4 is at distributor1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist4 is at distributor1, pallet5 is clear, crate0 is at distributor0, hoist5 is at distributor2, truck1 is at depot1, crate0 is on pallet3, pallet0 is clear, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, pallet4 is clear, pallet5 is at distributor2, hoist3 is available, crate1 is on pallet2, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is at depot2, hoist5 is available, pallet1 is clear, crate0 is clear, hoist3 is at distributor0, truck2 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist1 is available, truck0 is at distributor0, crate2 is on crate1, crate3 is clear, hoist4 is available, hoist0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate2 and pallet3 is at distributor0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot0 to depot2, hoist2 lifts crate3 from crate2 at depot2, crate3 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate1 at depot2, crate2 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate1 from pallet2 at depot2, crate1 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, truck2 is driven from depot2 to distributor0, hoist3 lifts crate0 from pallet3 at distributor0 and crate0 is loaded by hoist3 into truck2 at distributor0 to reach the current state.

Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location. A crate can only be at one location. A crate can only be on top of one surface. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist2 is available, crate2 is at depot2, pallet2 is at depot2, crate1 is at depot2, pallet4 is at distributor1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist4 is at distributor1, pallet5 is clear, crate0 is at distributor0, hoist5 is at distributor2, truck1 is at depot1, crate0 is on pallet3, pallet0 is clear, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, pallet4 is clear, pallet5 is at distributor2, hoist3 is available, crate1 is on pallet2, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is at depot2, hoist5 is available, pallet1 is clear, crate0 is clear, hoist3 is at distributor0, truck2 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist1 is available, truck0 is at distributor0, crate2 is on crate1, crate3 is clear, hoist4 is available, hoist0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate2 and pallet3 is at distributor0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot0 to depot2, hoist2 lifts crate3 from crate2 at depot2, crate3 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate1 at depot2, crate2 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate1 from pallet2 at depot2, crate1 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, truck2 is driven from depot2 to distributor0, hoist3 lifts crate0 from pallet3 at distributor0, crate0 is loaded by hoist3 into truck2 at distributor0, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck2 at distributor0, truck2 is driven from distributor0 to distributor1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist4 from truck2 at distributor1, truck2 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2, crate3 is unloaded by hoist5 from truck2 at distributor2, hoist3 drops crate1 on pallet3 at distributor0, hoist4 drops crate2 on pallet4 at distributor1, hoist5 drops crate3 on pallet5 at distributor2 and crate0 is unloaded by hoist5 from truck2 at distributor2 to reach the current state.

Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location. A crate can only be at one location. A crate can only be on top of one surface. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist2 is available, crate2 is at depot2, pallet2 is at depot2, crate1 is at depot2, pallet4 is at distributor1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist4 is at distributor1, pallet5 is clear, crate0 is at distributor0, hoist5 is at distributor2, truck1 is at depot1, crate0 is on pallet3, pallet0 is clear, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, pallet4 is clear, pallet5 is at distributor2, hoist3 is available, crate1 is on pallet2, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is at depot2, hoist5 is available, pallet1 is clear, crate0 is clear, hoist3 is at distributor0, truck2 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist1 is available, truck0 is at distributor0, crate2 is on crate1, crate3 is clear, hoist4 is available, hoist0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate2 and pallet3 is at distributor0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot0 to depot2, hoist2 lifts crate3 from crate2 at depot2, crate3 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate1 at depot2, crate2 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate1 from pallet2 at depot2, crate1 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, truck2 is driven from depot2 to distributor0, hoist3 lifts crate0 from pallet3 at distributor0 and crate0 is loaded by hoist3 into truck2 at distributor0 to reach the current state.

Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location. A crate can only be at one location. A crate can only be on top of one surface. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist2 is available, crate2 is at depot2, pallet2 is at depot2, crate1 is at depot2, pallet4 is at distributor1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist4 is at distributor1, pallet5 is clear, crate0 is at distributor0, hoist5 is at distributor2, truck1 is at depot1, crate0 is on pallet3, pallet0 is clear, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, pallet4 is clear, pallet5 is at distributor2, hoist3 is available, crate1 is on pallet2, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is at depot2, hoist5 is available, pallet1 is clear, crate0 is clear, hoist3 is at distributor0, truck2 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist1 is available, truck0 is at distributor0, crate2 is on crate1, crate3 is clear, hoist4 is available, hoist0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate2 and pallet3 is at distributor0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot0 to depot2, hoist2 lifts crate3 from crate2 at depot2, crate3 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate1 at depot2, crate2 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate1 from pallet2 at depot2, crate1 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, truck2 is driven from depot2 to distributor0, hoist3 lifts crate0 from pallet3 at distributor0, crate0 is loaded by hoist3 into truck2 at distributor0, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck2 at distributor0, truck2 is driven from distributor0 to distributor1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist4 from truck2 at distributor1, truck2 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2, crate3 is unloaded by hoist5 from truck2 at distributor2, hoist3 drops crate1 on pallet3 at distributor0, hoist4 drops crate2 on pallet4 at distributor1, hoist5 drops crate3 on pallet5 at distributor2 and crate0 is unloaded by hoist5 from truck2 at distributor2 to reach the current state.

Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface and be present at the location where it was dropped. It also causes the hoist to not lift the crate. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be not lifting the crate, and the crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck causes the crate to be not in the truck, and the hoist to be lifting the crate. A hoist is available if and only if it does not lift anything (any crate). A surface  is clear if and only if no crates are on top of that surface. A crate is clear if and only if no hoist is lifting that crate. A truck can be only at one location. A crate can only be at one location. A crate can only be on top of one surface. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, hoist2 is available, crate2 is at depot2, pallet2 is at depot2, crate1 is at depot2, pallet4 is at distributor1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist4 is at distributor1, pallet5 is clear, crate0 is at distributor0, hoist5 is at distributor2, truck1 is at depot1, crate0 is on pallet3, pallet0 is clear, pallet0 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, pallet4 is clear, pallet5 is at distributor2, hoist3 is available, crate1 is on pallet2, pallet1 is at depot1, crate3 is at depot2, hoist5 is available, pallet1 is clear, crate0 is clear, hoist3 is at distributor0, truck2 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist1 is available, truck0 is at distributor0, crate2 is on crate1, crate3 is clear, hoist4 is available, hoist0 is at depot0, crate3 is on crate2 and pallet3 is at distributor0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: truck2 is driven from depot0 to depot2, hoist2 lifts crate3 from crate2 at depot2, crate3 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate1 at depot2, crate2 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, hoist2 lifts crate1 from pallet2 at depot2, crate1 is loaded by hoist2 into truck2 at depot2, truck2 is driven from depot2 to distributor0, hoist3 lifts crate0 from pallet3 at distributor0, crate0 is loaded by hoist3 into truck2 at distributor0, crate1 is unloaded by hoist3 from truck2 at distributor0, truck2 is driven from distributor0 to distributor1, crate2 is unloaded by hoist4 from truck2 at distributor1, truck2 is driven from distributor1 to distributor2, crate3 is unloaded by hoist5 from truck2 at distributor2, hoist3 drops crate1 on pallet3 at distributor0, hoist4 drops crate2 on pallet4 at distributor1, hoist5 drops crate3 on pallet5 at distributor2 and crate0 is unloaded by hoist5 from truck2 at distributor2 to reach the current state. In this state, some valid property of the state that involves a negation may or may not be defined. What valid property of the state that involves a negation out of, crate3 is not on pallet4, pallet3 is not at depot1, pallet0 is not at distributor0, pallet3 is not at depot0, hoist4 is not lifting crate0, pallet4 is not at depot1, pallet4 is not clear, pallet2 is not at distributor2, crate1 is not on crate0, hoist4 is not lifting crate3, hoist5 is not available, hoist1 is not lifting crate1, truck0 is not at depot1, truck1 is not at distributor1, hoist5 is not at depot0, hoist0 is not at depot2, crate0 is not at distributor1, crate1 is not at depot0, crate0 is not on crate3, truck1 is not at depot0, crate3 is not in truck0, crate1 is not on pallet2, hoist2 is not lifting crate3, crate2 is not in truck2, crate3 is not on crate2, truck1 is not at distributor2, crate0 is not on pallet5, crate0 is not at depot0, crate2 is not on pallet3, pallet2 is not at distributor0, pallet5 is not at distributor1, hoist4 is not at depot1, crate0 is not clear, pallet3 is not clear, pallet2 is not at depot1, pallet2 is not at depot0, pallet3 is not at distributor1, crate1 is not on crate1, crate1 is not at depot1, crate0 is not on crate2, crate2 is not on pallet5 and crate2 is not next to truck1, is not defined? Write None if all are defined.\n\n[ANSWER]:\n"}

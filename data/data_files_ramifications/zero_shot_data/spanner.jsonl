Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time.

Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time.

Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time.

Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time.

Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened. The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, location1 is linked to location2, location4 is linked to location5, spanner1 is at location3, location3 is linked to location4, nut1 is at gate, spanner3 is usable, spanner2 is at location5, nut5 is loose, spanner5 is usable, spanner4 is at location6, spanner2 is usable, nut5 is at gate, location6 is linked to location7, nut2 is at gate, location2 is linked to location3, location9 is linked to gate, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is at location2, spanner1 is usable, location5 is linked to location6, nut1 is loose, spanner5 is at location3, spanner4 is usable, location8 is linked to location9, bob is at shed, nut3 is loose, location7 is linked to location8, nut4 is loose, nut3 is at gate, shed is linked to location1 and nut4 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob walks from shed to location1 to reach the current state. In this state, some properties of the state may or may not be defined. Is it True or False that location2 is linked to location3?\n\n[ANSWER]:\n"}

Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location.

Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened. The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, location1 is linked to location2, location4 is linked to location5, spanner1 is at location3, location3 is linked to location4, nut1 is at gate, spanner3 is usable, spanner2 is at location5, nut5 is loose, spanner5 is usable, spanner4 is at location6, spanner2 is usable, nut5 is at gate, location6 is linked to location7, nut2 is at gate, location2 is linked to location3, location9 is linked to gate, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is at location2, spanner1 is usable, location5 is linked to location6, nut1 is loose, spanner5 is at location3, spanner4 is usable, location8 is linked to location9, bob is at shed, nut3 is loose, location7 is linked to location8, nut4 is loose, nut3 is at gate, shed is linked to location1 and nut4 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are planned to be performed: bob walks from shed to location1, bob walks from location1 to location2, bob picks up spanner3 from location2, bob walks from location2 to location3, bob picks up spanner5 from location3, bob picks up spanner1 from location3, bob walks from location3 to location4, bob walks from location4 to location5, bob picks up spanner2 from location5 and bob walks from location5 to location6 to reach the current state.

Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened. The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, location1 is linked to location2, location4 is linked to location5, spanner1 is at location3, location3 is linked to location4, nut1 is at gate, spanner3 is usable, spanner2 is at location5, nut5 is loose, spanner5 is usable, spanner4 is at location6, spanner2 is usable, nut5 is at gate, location6 is linked to location7, nut2 is at gate, location2 is linked to location3, location9 is linked to gate, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is at location2, spanner1 is usable, location5 is linked to location6, nut1 is loose, spanner5 is at location3, spanner4 is usable, location8 is linked to location9, bob is at shed, nut3 is loose, location7 is linked to location8, nut4 is loose, nut3 is at gate, shed is linked to location1 and nut4 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob walks from shed to location1, bob walks from location1 to location2, bob picks up spanner3 from location2, bob walks from location2 to location3, bob picks up spanner5 from location3, bob picks up spanner1 from location3, bob walks from location3 to location4, bob walks from location4 to location5, bob picks up spanner2 from location5, bob walks from location5 to location6, bob picks up spanner4 from location6, bob walks from location6 to location7, bob walks from location7 to location8, bob walks from location8 to location9 and bob walks from location9 to gate to reach the current state.

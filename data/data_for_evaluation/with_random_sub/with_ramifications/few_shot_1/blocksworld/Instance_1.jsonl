Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja other properties.

Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja themselves. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is being casqqrrojp, a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh, a qbyyxzqvdh is not being casqqrrojp and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh.

Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja other properties.

Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja themselves. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is being casqqrrojp, a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh, a qbyyxzqvdh is not being casqqrrojp and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is clear, egpbpdtalq is empty, a qbyyxzqvdh is not clear and egpbpdtalq is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja themselves. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is being casqqrrojp, a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh, a qbyyxzqvdh is not being casqqrrojp and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is clear, egpbpdtalq is empty, a qbyyxzqvdh is not clear and egpbpdtalq is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja themselves. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is being casqqrrojp, a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh, a qbyyxzqvdh is not being casqqrrojp and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh.

In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja other properties.

A qbyyxzqvdh can be oscckwdtoh wtuwjwbuja the second qbyyxzqvdh if it is being casqqrrojp and the second qbyyxzqvdh is clear. By oscckwdtoh the first qbyyxzqvdh wtuwjwbuja the second, it causes the first qbyyxzqvdh to be wtuwjwbuja top of the second qbyyxzqvdh. The qbyyxzqvdh can also be wxqdwukszo from the top of the second qbyyxzqvdh only if the egpbpdtalq is empty and the first qbyyxzqvdh is clear and wtuwjwbuja top of the second qbyyxzqvdh. Wxqdwukszo the first qbyyxzqvdh from the second causes first qbyyxzqvdh to be casqqrrojp a qbyyxzqvdh is said to be clear if it is not being casqqrrojp and there are no qbyyxzqvdhs that are wtuwjwbuja top of it. The egpbpdtalq is said to be empty if and only if it is not casqqrrojp any qbyyxzqvdh. The qbyyxzqvdh can only be at one place at a time.\n\na state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is clear, egpbpdtalq is empty, a qbyyxzqvdh is not clear and egpbpdtalq is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja themselves. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is being casqqrrojp, a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh, a qbyyxzqvdh is not being casqqrrojp and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh.

By oscckwdtoh the first qbyyxzqvdh wtuwjwbuja the second, it causes the first qbyyxzqvdh to be wtuwjwbuja top of the second qbyyxzqvdh. The qbyyxzqvdh can also be wxqdwukszo from the top of the second qbyyxzqvdh only if the egpbpdtalq is empty and the first qbyyxzqvdh is clear and wtuwjwbuja top of the second qbyyxzqvdh.

Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is clear, egpbpdtalq is empty, a qbyyxzqvdh is not clear and egpbpdtalq is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja themselves. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is being casqqrrojp, a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh, a qbyyxzqvdh is not being casqqrrojp and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh.

Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is clear, egpbpdtalq is empty, a qbyyxzqvdh is not clear and egpbpdtalq is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja themselves. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is being casqqrrojp, a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh, a qbyyxzqvdh is not being casqqrrojp and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh.

Properties may or may not involve negations. Properties of the state can be of 4 types: base, derived, persistent, and static. Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is clear, egpbpdtalq is empty, a qbyyxzqvdh is not clear and egpbpdtalq is not empty. Self constraint properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja themselves. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is being casqqrrojp, a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh, a qbyyxzqvdh is not being casqqrrojp and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja another qbyyxzqvdh. Static properties of the state are properties that don't change under any action.

Base properties of the state are properties that don't depend wtuwjwbuja other properties. In this domain, they are: a qbyyxzqvdh is wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv and a qbyyxzqvdh is not wtuwjwbuja the gcbwvwyvkv. Derived properties of the state are properties that depend wtuwjwbuja other properties.

By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block. Furthermore, the hand is not empty.\\n\\nA state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations.

A truck can be driven from one location to another only if it is present at the first location.

A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate, the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate.

The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\\n\\nA state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations.

Moving causes the robot to be at the new location, and it is no longer at the previous location. The robot is capable of picking up a laser at a specific location if it is at that location, the laser is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the laser results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, holding the laser, and the laser no longer being at that location. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot's arm being no longer empty, and it now holds the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the robot's arm being empty, not holding the laser, and the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot's arm becoming empty and not holding the bomb anymore. The second location becomes clear and the soft rock is destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination being clear, with no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks at the destination. Finally, the robot can pick up gold at a specific location if it is at that location, the robot's arm is empty, and there is gold at that location. Picking up gold results in the robot's arm no longer being empty, and it now holds the gold.\\n\\nA state is a set of valid properties. Properties may or may not involve negations.

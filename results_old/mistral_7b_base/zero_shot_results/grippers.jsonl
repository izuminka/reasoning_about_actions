Moving the robot causes it to be not in the said room but in the destination room. A robot can pick up the object using a gripper only when the object and the robot are in the same room and the mentioned gripper is free. Picking up the object causes the robot to carry that object using its gripper, the object to be not in that room, and the said gripper not free. Dropping the object in a specified room is only executable when the robot is carrying that object using its gripper, and the robot is in the said room. Dropping an object in a room makes the object be in that room, the gripper be free and the robot not carrying the object anymore.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, rgripper1 of robot1 is free, ball2 is at room2, lgripper1 of robot1 is free, ball4 is at room2, ball1 is at room1, ball6 is at room1, robot1 is at room4, ball5 is at room2 and ball3 is at room1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: robot1 moves from room4 to room1, ball1 is picked from room1 with lgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room1 to room2, ball2 is picked from room2 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room2 to room3, ball1 is dropped in room3 with lgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room3 to room4, ball2 is dropped in room4 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room4 to room2, ball4 is picked from room2 with lgripper1 by robot1, ball5 is picked from room2 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room2 to room5, ball4 is dropped in room5 with lgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room5 to room1, ball3 is picked from room1 with lgripper1 by robot1, ball5 is dropped in room1 with rgripper1 by robot1, ball6 is picked from room1 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room1 to room5 and ball3 is dropped in room5 with lgripper1 by robot1 to reach the current state. In this state, some valid property of the state may or may not be defined. What valid property of the state out of, ball1 is at room3, ball2 is at room4 and robot1 is loading ball6 with rgripper1, is not defined? Write None if all are defined.\n\n[ANSWER]:\n","output":"[ANSWER]:\nball1 is at room3\n\n[EXPLANATION]:\nThe robot is not loading ball6 with rgripper1.\n\n[SOLUTION]:\n\n[SOLUTION]:\n\n[SOLUTION]:\n\n[SOLUTION]:\n\n[SOLUTION]:\n\n[SOLUTION]:\n\n[SOLUTION]:\n\n[SOLUTION]:\n\n[SOLUTION"},{"id":"9c67655a-3c87-4742-977a-2046e7ef0425","plan_length":19,"question_category":"hallucination","question_name":"question_8","answer_type":"free_answer","prompt":"A robot can move from a specified room if it is in that room.

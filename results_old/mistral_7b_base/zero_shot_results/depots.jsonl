A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear. Lifting causes the hoist to lift the crate  the crate to be not in that location, not clear, and not on top of the previous surface, which is now clear. Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear. Dropping the crate causes it to be on top of the surface, be present in the location where it was dropped, and be clear. It also causes the hoist to become available, and not lift the crate. The surface on which the crate was dropped becomes not clear. Loading the crate on a truck can be executed only when the crate and truck are present in the same location, and the hoist is lifting the crate. Loading the crate onto the truck causes the hoist to be available and not lifting the crate, and crate to be in the truck. Unloading the crate from the truck can be done only if the hoist and truck are in the same place, the hoist is available, and the crate is present in the truck.

A hoist can lift a crate from a surface only when the hoist and the crate are present in the same location, the hoist is available, the crate is present on the surface, and the crate is clear.

Moreover, lifting the crate causes the hoist to be not available. Dropping the crate is possible only if the hoist, crate, and surface are present in the same location, the hoist is lifting the crate, and the surface is clear.

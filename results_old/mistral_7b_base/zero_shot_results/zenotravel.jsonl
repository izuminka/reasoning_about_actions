It changes the current fuel level to its next level.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, person5 is at city1, person6 is at city2, fuel level fl1 is next to fuel level fl0, plane1 is at city1, fuel level fl4 is next to fuel level fl3, person7 is at city0, plane1 has fuel level fl0, person4 is at city0, fuel level fl6 is next to fuel level fl5, fuel level fl3 is next to fuel level fl2, fuel level fl2 is next to fuel level fl1, person3 is at city1, person2 is at city1, fuel level fl5 is next to fuel level fl4 and person1 is at city1\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: plane1 gets refueled at city1 with fuel level fl0 to fl1, plane1 flies from city1 to city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl0, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl0 to fl1, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl2, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl2 to fl3, person7 boards plane1 at city0, person4 boards plane1 at city0, plane1 flies from city0 to city1 with fuel level fl3 to fl2, person7 departs plane1 at city1, person5 boards plane1 at city1, person3 boards plane1 at city1, person2 boards plane1 at city1, plane1 flies from city1 to city2 with fuel level fl2 to fl1, person6 boards plane1 at city2, person5 departs plane1 at city2, person4 departs plane1 at city2, person3 departs plane1 at city2, person2 departs plane1 at city2 and plane1 flies from city2 to city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl0 to reach the current state. In this state, some valid property of the state that involves a negation may or may not be defined. What valid property of the state that involves a negation out of, fuel level fl3 is not next to fuel level fl1, fuel level fl4 is not next to fuel level fl0, person7 is not at city2, person1 is not in plane1, fuel level fl4 is not next to fuel level fl5, plane1 does not have fuel level fl2, plane1 is not at city1, fuel level fl5 is not next to fuel level fl1, fuel level fl0 is not next to fuel level fl3, person6 is not at city1, person1 is not at city0, person5 is not at city1, fuel level fl2 is not next to fuel level fl5, fuel level fl6 is not next to fuel level fl1 and fuel level fl3 is not next to fuel level fl5, is not defined? Write None if all are defined.\n\n[ANSWER]:\n","output":"[ANSWER]:\nfuel level fl3 is not next to fuel level fl1\n\n[EXPLANATION]\nThe property is defined because the fuel level of the aircraft is fl3 and the fuel level of the aircraft is not next to the fuel level fl1.\n\n[SOLUTION]\n\n[SOLUTION EXPLANATION]\n\n[SOLUTION]\n\n[SOLUTION EXPLANATION]\n\n[SOLUTION"}]

Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block.

Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, block b7 is on the table, block b5 is on the table, block b2 is clear, block b3 is on block b4, block b1 is on block b7, hand is empty, block b9 is clear, block b4 is on the table, block b6 is on block b3, block b5 is clear, block b8 is on block b1, block b9 is on block b8 and block b2 is on block b6\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: block b9 is unstacked from block b8, block b9 is put down, block b2 is unstacked from block b6, block b2 is stacked on top block b5 and block b6 is unstacked from block b3 to reach the current state.

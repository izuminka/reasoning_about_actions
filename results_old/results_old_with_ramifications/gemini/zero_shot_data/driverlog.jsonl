Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver). A driver is driving the truck if and only if the driver is not at a location An object can only be at one location.

To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver). A driver is driving the truck if and only if the driver is not at a location An object can only be at one location.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

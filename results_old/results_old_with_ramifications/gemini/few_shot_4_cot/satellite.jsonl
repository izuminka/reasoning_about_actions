direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite.

Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously.

Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, satellite0 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, satellite0 turns to star10 from planet13, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, instrument1 on satellite0 is switched off, instrument2 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to star4 from star10, instrument2 is calibrated on satellite0 to star4, satellite0 turns to star16 from star4, image of star16 is taken with instrument2 on satellite0 in image0 and instrument2 on satellite0 is switched off to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, satellite0 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2 and satellite0 turns to star10 from planet13 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, satellite0 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2 and satellite0 turns to star10 from planet13 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, satellite0 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, satellite0 turns to star10 from planet13, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, instrument1 on satellite0 is switched off, instrument2 on satellite0 is switched on and satellite0 turns to star4 from star10 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on to reach the current state.

Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0 and image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0 and image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0 and image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0 and image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, satellite0 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2 and satellite0 turns to star10 from planet13 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, satellite0 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2 and satellite0 turns to star10 from planet13 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, satellite0 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, satellite0 turns to star10 from planet13, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, instrument1 on satellite0 is switched off, instrument2 on satellite0 is switched on and satellite0 turns to star4 from star10 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, satellite0 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, satellite0 turns to star10 from planet13, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, instrument1 on satellite0 is switched off, instrument2 on satellite0 is switched on and satellite0 turns to star4 from star10 to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, satellite0 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, satellite0 turns to star10 from planet13, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, instrument1 on satellite0 is switched off, instrument2 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to star4 from star10, instrument2 is calibrated on satellite0 to star4, satellite0 turns to star16 from star4, image of star16 is taken with instrument2 on satellite0 in image0 and instrument2 on satellite0 is switched off to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: instrument1 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to groundstation0 from groundstation2, instrument1 is calibrated on satellite0 to groundstation0, satellite0 turns to planet11 from groundstation0, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet11 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, satellite0 turns to planet13 from planet11, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image5, image of planet13 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, satellite0 turns to star10 from planet13, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in image6, image of star10 is taken with instrument1 on satellite0 in spectrograph2, instrument1 on satellite0 is switched off, instrument2 on satellite0 is switched on, satellite0 turns to star4 from star10, instrument2 is calibrated on satellite0 to star4, satellite0 turns to star16 from star4, image of star16 is taken with instrument2 on satellite0 in image0 and instrument2 on satellite0 is switched off to reach the current state.

direction is executable if the satellite is facing to the source direction initially. Turning a satellite to the intended direction from the source direction causes the satellite to point to the intended direction. The satellite cannot point to two different directions simultaneously. Switching on the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and power is available on the satellite. Switching on the instrument on a satellite causes the instrument to be powered on but not calibrated. If the instrument is powered on then the satellite does not have power. Switching off the instrument on a satellite is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite and the instrument is powered on. Switching off the instrument on the satellite causes the instrument to be powered off. If the instrument is not powered on then power is available on the satellite. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is onboard with the satellite, calibration target of the instrument is set to the intended direction, the satellite is pointing to the intended direction and the instrument is powered on. Calibrating the instrument on the satellite to the intended direction causes the instrument to be calibrated. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode which is facing to the intended direction is executable if the instrument is calibrated, instrument is onboard with the satellite, the instrument supports the mode to which it is set to, the instrument is powered on and the satellite is pointing to the intended direction. Taking an image on the satellite with the instrument set to a mode facing to the intended direction causes it to capture an image of the intended direction with the mode with which the instrument was set to. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, instrument2 supports image0, instrument3 is on board satellite0, satellite0 is pointing to groundstation2, instrument1 supports image5, instrument2 supports image1, instrument0 is on board satellite0, instrument2 is on board satellite0, instrument3 supports image1, instrument1 supports image6, instrument4 supports image1, instrument1 is on board satellite0, instrument0 is calibrated for star3, instrument4 is calibrated for groundstation8, instrument4 supports infrared7, instrument3 supports spectrograph4, instrument4 is on board satellite1, satellite0 has power available, satellite1 has power available, instrument3 is calibrated for groundstation9, instrument3 supports thermograph3, instrument2 is calibrated for star4, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation6, instrument0 supports image6, satellite1 is pointing to planet13, instrument1 is calibrated for groundstation0, instrument0 is calibrated for groundstation7 and instrument1 supports spectrograph2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are planned to be performed: image of planet11 is taken with instrument4 on satellite0 in image1.

I'm happy to help you with your question.\n\nTo determine whether tile t_1 is at position p_3_3, we need to analyze the given initial conditions and the actions performed to reach the current state.\n\nFrom the initial conditions, we know that tile t_1 is at position p_2_3.\n\nNow, let's consider the actions performed:\n\n1. Tile t_3 is moved from position p_2_2 to position p_3_2.\n2. Tile t_4 is moved from position p_1_2 to position p_1_1.\n\nFrom these actions, we can see that tile t_4 is moved from a neighbor of position p_2_3 to position p_1_1. Since tile t_4 is moved from a neighbor of position p_2_3, it means that position p_2_3 is now empty.\n\nNow, let's analyze the position of tile t_1:\n\n1. Tile t_1 is at position p_2_3.\n2. Position p_2_3 is empty after tile t_4 is moved from a neighbor of position p_2_3 to position p_1_1.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that tile t_1 is no longer at position p_2_3, and its new position is empty.\n\nSo, the answer to your question is: False.

However, there is no information provided about the relationship between position p_2_1 and position p_3_1.\n\nWhen the actions are performed to reach the current state, tile t_7 is moved from position p_1_2 to position p_2_2, and tile t_8 is moved from position p_1_3 to position p_1_2. These actions do not provide any information about the relationship between position p_2_1 and position p_3_1.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is impossible to determine whether position p_2_1 is a neighbor of position p_3_1.

I'm happy to help you with your question.\n\nTo answer your question, we need to analyze the current state and the actions that have been performed to reach it. Based on the initial conditions and the actions taken, we can determine the valid properties of the state that involve p_1_2.\n\nFrom the initial conditions, we know that tile t_1 is at position p_2_3, position p_1_1 is a neighbor of position p_1_2, position p_1_1 is a neighbor of position p_2_1, and position p_1_3 is a neighbor of position p_2_3.\n\nNow, let's consider the actions performed to reach the current state. We know that tile t_3 has been moved from position p_2_2 to position p_3_2. This means that position p_2_2 is no longer the current position of tile t_3.\n\nSince position p_1_2 is a neighbor of position p_2_2, we can conclude that position p_1_2 is also a neighbor of the new position of tile t_3, which is position p_3_2.\n\nTherefore, the valid properties of the state that involve p_1_2 are:\n\n* Position p_1_2 is a neighbor of position p_3_2.\n\nI hope this helps!

The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, spanner5 is at location6, nut1 is loose, nut2 is at gate, spanner2 is usable, spanner1 is at location8, nut3 is at gate, location4 is linked to location5, spanner5 is usable, bob is at shed, location1 is linked to location2, location6 is linked to location7, nut4 is at gate, spanner3 is at location2, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is usable, spanner4 is at location2, location3 is linked to location4, location7 is linked to location8, location8 is linked to location9, location9 is linked to gate, location2 is linked to location3, nut1 is at gate, location5 is linked to location6, spanner2 is at location6, nut5 is loose, nut3 is loose, nut4 is loose, spanner4 is usable, shed is linked to location1, spanner1 is usable and nut5 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob walks from shed to location1 to reach the current state.

Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time.

I'm happy to help you with that. Let's go through the question step by step:\n\nWhat is the object type for spanner4?\n\nSpanner4 is a spanner, which is an object that can be used to tighten or loosen nuts. Therefore, the object type for spanner4 is \"spanner\".\n\nWhat is the object type for spanner1?\n\nSpanner1 is a spanner, which is an object that can be used to tighten or loosen nuts. Therefore, the object type for spanner1 is \"spanner\".\n\nWhat is the object type for spanner3?\n\nSpanner3 is a spanner, which is an object that can be used to tighten or loosen nuts. Therefore, the object type for spanner3 is \"spanner\".\n\nWhat is the object type for spanner2?\n\nSpanner2 is a spanner, which is an object that can be used to tighten or loosen nuts. Therefore, the object type for spanner2 is \"spanner\".\n\nWhat is the object type for spanner5?\n\nSpanner5 is a spanner, which is an object that can be used to tighten or loosen nuts. Therefore, the object type for spanner5 is \"spanner\".\n\nIn each of the above cases, the object type is \"spanner\", so the answer is the same for all of them: \"spanner\".\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?"}

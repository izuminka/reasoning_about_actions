Boarding the lift causes the passenger to be boarded. Departing from the lift is executable only when the lift is on the floor, the passenger is boarded, and the passenger's destination is on that floor. Departing from the lift causes the passenger to be served. A lift can go up from one floor to another if and only if it is currently on the floor and the destination floor is above the source floor. Going up makes the lift on the destination floor. A lift can go down from one floor to another if and only if it is currently on a floor and the source floor is above the destination floor.

"prompt": "To load an object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s2, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_3, there is a path between location s3 and location p4_3, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p4_0, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s5, truck1 is at loaction s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s5, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_1, there is a path between location s5 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s5 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s0, there is a path between location s5 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s3, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s4, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s1 and location p4_1, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_0, driver2 is at loaction s4, driver1 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s4, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s4, there is a link between location s4 and location s3, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s5, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s1, truck2 is empty, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s5, there is a link between location s4 and location s0, there is a path between location s2 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s5, there is a link between location s5 and location s3, package4 is at loaction s0 and truck1 is empty\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver1 walks from location s3 to location p4_3 to reach the current state.

Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s2, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_3, there is a path between location s3 and location p4_3, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p4_0, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s5, truck1 is at loaction s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s5, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_1, there is a path between location s5 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s5 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s0, there is a path between location s5 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s3, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s4, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s1 and location p4_1, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_0, driver2 is at loaction s4, driver1 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s4, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s4, there is a link between location s4 and location s3, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s5, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s1, truck2 is empty, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s5, there is a link between location s4 and location s0, there is a path between location s2 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s5, there is a link between location s5 and location s3, package4 is at loaction s0 and truck1 is empty\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver1 walks from location s3 to location p4_3, driver1 walks from location p4_3 to location s4, driver1 walks from location s4 to location p4_1, driver1 walks from location p4_1 to location s1 and driver1 boards truck1 at location s1 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

"prompt": "To load an object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s2, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_3, there is a path between location s3 and location p4_3, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p4_0, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s5, truck1 is at loaction s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s5, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_1, there is a path between location s5 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s5 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s0, there is a path between location s5 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s3, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s4, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s1 and location p4_1, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_0, driver2 is at loaction s4, driver1 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s4, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s4, there is a link between location s4 and location s3, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s5, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s1, truck2 is empty, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s5, there is a link between location s4 and location s0, there is a path between location s2 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s5, there is a link between location s5 and location s3, package4 is at loaction s0 and truck1 is empty\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver1 walks from location s3 to location p4_3 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

"prompt": "To load an object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

"prompt": "To load an object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s2, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_3, there is a path between location s3 and location p4_3, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p4_0, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s5, truck1 is at loaction s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s5, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_1, there is a path between location s5 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s5 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s0, there is a path between location s5 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s3, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s4, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s1 and location p4_1, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_0, driver2 is at loaction s4, driver1 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s4, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s4, there is a link between location s4 and location s3, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s5, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s1, truck2 is empty, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s5, there is a link between location s4 and location s0, there is a path between location s2 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s5, there is a link between location s5 and location s3, package4 is at loaction s0 and truck1 is empty\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver1 walks from location s3 to location p4_3, driver1 walks from location p4_3 to location s4, driver1 walks from location s4 to location p4_1, driver1 walks from location p4_1 to location s1, driver1 boards truck1 at location s1, s1 drives truck1 from location s0 to location driver1, package4 is loaded in truck1 at location s0, s0 drives truck1 from location s2 to location driver1, package2 is loaded in truck1 at location s2 and package1 is loaded in truck1 at location s2 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s2, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_3, there is a path between location s3 and location p4_3, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p4_0, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s5, truck1 is at loaction s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s5, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_1, there is a path between location s5 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s5 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s0, there is a path between location s5 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s3, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s4, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s1 and location p4_1, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_0, driver2 is at loaction s4, driver1 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s4, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s4, there is a link between location s4 and location s3, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s5, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s1, truck2 is empty, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s5, there is a link between location s4 and location s0, there is a path between location s2 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s5, there is a link between location s5 and location s3, package4 is at loaction s0 and truck1 is empty\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver1 walks from location s3 to location p4_3, driver1 walks from location p4_3 to location s4, driver1 walks from location s4 to location p4_1, driver1 walks from location p4_1 to location s1 and driver1 boards truck1 at location s1 to reach the current state.

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty.

Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s2, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_3, there is a path between location s3 and location p4_3, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p4_0, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s5, truck1 is at loaction s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s5, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_1, there is a path between location s5 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s5 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s0, there is a path between location s5 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s3, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s4, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s1 and location p4_1, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_0, driver2 is at loaction s4, driver1 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s4, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s4, there is a link between location s4 and location s3, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s5, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s1, truck2 is empty, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s5, there is a link between location s4 and location s0, there is a path between location s2 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s5, there is a link between location s5 and location s3, package4 is at loaction s0 and truck1 is empty\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver1 walks from location s3 to location p4_3, driver1 walks from location p4_3 to location s4, driver1 walks from location s4 to location p4_1, driver1 walks from location p4_1 to location s1, driver1 boards truck1 at location s1, s1 drives truck1 from location s0 to location driver1, package4 is loaded in truck1 at location s0, s0 drives truck1 from location s2 to location driver1, package2 is loaded in truck1 at location s2, package1 is loaded in truck1 at location s2, s2 drives truck1 from location s3 to location driver1, package3 is loaded in truck1 at location s3, package1 is unload from truck1 at location s3, s3 drives truck1 from location s4 to location driver1 and package4 is unload from truck1 at location s4 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

"prompt": "To load an object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

"prompt": "To load an object onto a truck at a location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s2, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_3, there is a path between location s3 and location p4_3, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p4_0, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s5, truck1 is at loaction s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s5, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_1, there is a path between location s5 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s5 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s0, there is a path between location s5 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s3, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s4, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s1 and location p4_1, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_0, driver2 is at loaction s4, driver1 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s4, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s4, there is a link between location s4 and location s3, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s5, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s1, truck2 is empty, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s5, there is a link between location s4 and location s0, there is a path between location s2 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s5, there is a link between location s5 and location s3, package4 is at loaction s0 and truck1 is empty\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver1 walks from location s3 to location p4_3, driver1 walks from location p4_3 to location s4, driver1 walks from location s4 to location p4_1, driver1 walks from location p4_1 to location s1, driver1 boards truck1 at location s1, s1 drives truck1 from location s0 to location driver1, package4 is loaded in truck1 at location s0, s0 drives truck1 from location s2 to location driver1, package2 is loaded in truck1 at location s2, package1 is loaded in truck1 at location s2, s2 drives truck1 from location s3 to location driver1, package3 is loaded in truck1 at location s3, package1 is unload from truck1 at location s3, s3 drives truck1 from location s4 to location driver1, package4 is unload from truck1 at location s4, package3 is unload from truck1 at location s4, package2 is unload from truck1 at location s4, s4 drives truck1 from location s1 to location driver1 and driver1 disembarks from truck1 at location s1 to reach the current state.

To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s2, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_3, there is a path between location s3 and location p4_3, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p4_0, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s5, truck1 is at loaction s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s5, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_1, there is a path between location s5 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s5 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s0, there is a path between location s5 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s3, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s4, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s1 and location p4_1, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_0, driver2 is at loaction s4, driver1 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s4, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s4, there is a link between location s4 and location s3, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s5, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s1, truck2 is empty, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s5, there is a link between location s4 and location s0, there is a path between location s2 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s5, there is a link between location s5 and location s3, package4 is at loaction s0 and truck1 is empty\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver1 walks from location s3 to location p4_3 to reach the current state.

To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s2, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_3, there is a path between location s3 and location p4_3, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p4_0, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s5, truck1 is at loaction s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s5, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_1, there is a path between location s5 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s5 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s0, there is a path between location s5 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s3, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s4, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s1 and location p4_1, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_0, driver2 is at loaction s4, driver1 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s4, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s4, there is a link between location s4 and location s3, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s5, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s1, truck2 is empty, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s5, there is a link between location s4 and location s0, there is a path between location s2 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s5, there is a link between location s5 and location s3, package4 is at loaction s0 and truck1 is empty\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are planned to be performed: s4 drives truck2 from location p5_2 to location driver2 to reach the current state.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking causes the driver to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s2, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s0, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_3, there is a path between location s3 and location p4_3, package3 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p4_0, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s5, truck1 is at loaction s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s5, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_1, there is a path between location s5 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s5, there is a link between location s0 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s2, there is a link between location s5 and location s0, package2 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location p0_5 and location s0, there is a path between location s5 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s3, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s4, package1 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s1 and location p4_1, there is a path between location p4_3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, there is a path between location s4 and location p4_0, driver2 is at loaction s4, driver1 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s5 and location s4, there is a path between location p4_0 and location s4, there is a link between location s4 and location s3, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, there is a link between location s2 and location s3, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location p5_2 and location s5, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_5, there is a path between location p4_1 and location s1, truck2 is empty, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s5, there is a link between location s4 and location s0, there is a path between location s2 and location p5_2, there is a link between location s4 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s4, there is a link between location s1 and location s4, there is a link between location s3 and location s5, there is a link between location s5 and location s3, package4 is at loaction s0 and truck1 is empty\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver1 walks from location s3 to location p4_3, driver1 walks from location p4_3 to location s4, driver1 walks from location s4 to location p4_1, driver1 walks from location p4_1 to location s1, driver1 boards truck1 at location s1, s1 drives truck1 from location s0 to location driver1, package4 is loaded in truck1 at location s0, s0 drives truck1 from location s2 to location driver1, package2 is loaded in truck1 at location s2 and package1 is loaded in truck1 at location s2 to reach the current state.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to not be at its initial location and to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the specified location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to not be inside the truck and to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck makes the driver not be at the initial location, to be driving the truck, and the truck becomes not empty. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to stop driving the truck, be at the specified location, and the truck to be empty. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to no longer be at the initial location but to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Departing from the lift causes the passenger to be served and not boarded. A lift can go up from one floor to another if and only if it is currently on the floor and the destination floor is above the source floor. Going up makes the lift on the destination floor.

Departing from the lift causes the passenger to be served and not boarded. A lift can go up from one floor to another if and only if it is currently on the floor and the destination floor is above the source floor. Going up makes the lift on the destination floor.

Passenger p0 boards at floor f0 to reach the current state.\n\nAt this point, we need to check if the boarding of passenger p0 at floor f0 affects the destination of passenger p6. Since passenger p0 is boarded at floor f0, and destination of passenger p6 is floor f3, it means that passenger p6 will still be destined for floor f3, even after passenger p0 boards at floor f0.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is it True or False that destination of passenger p6 is floor f3?\" is True."}

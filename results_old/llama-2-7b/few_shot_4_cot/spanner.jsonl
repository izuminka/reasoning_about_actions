I'm happy to help you answer this question. Let's go through the steps together:\n\n1. Location 9 is linked to location 7, which means that bob can walk from location 9 to location 7.\n2. Location 5 is linked to location 8, which means that bob can walk from location 5 to location 8.\n3. Location 1 is linked to shed, which means that bob can walk from location 1 to shed.\n4. Spanner 5 is at location 8, which means that bob can use spanner 5 to tighten a nut at location 8.\n5. Shed is linked to location 9, which means that bob can walk from shed to location 9.\n6. Bob is at location 9, which means that he is currently at location 9.\n7. Spanner 3 is at location 6, which means that bob can use spanner 3 to tighten a nut at location 6.\n8. Location 5 is linked to location 1, which means that bob can walk from location 5 to location 1.\n9. Location 1 is linked to location 2, which means that bob can walk from location 1 to location 2.\n10. Location 4 is linked to location 5, which means that bob can walk from location 4 to location 5.\n11. Spanner 1 is at location 3, which means that bob can use spanner 1 to tighten a nut at location 3.\n12. Location 3 is linked to location 4, which means that bob can walk from location 3 to location 4.\n13. Nut 1 is at gate, which means that bob can use spanner 5 to tighten the nut at gate.\n14. Spanner 5 is usable, which means that bob can use spanner 5 to tighten the nut at gate.\n15. Nut 5 is loose, which means that bob can use spanner 5 to tighten the nut at gate.\n\nBased on these steps, the answer to the question is True."}

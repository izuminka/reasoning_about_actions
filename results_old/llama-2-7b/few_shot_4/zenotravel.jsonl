Debarking a person in the city causes the person to be present in the city and not present in the aircraft. Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level. Flying the aircraft from a city to a destination city causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft to the next level. Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down. Refueling the aircraft in a city is executable if the aircraft is in the city. It changes the current fuel level to its next level.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level fl1 is next to fuel level fl0, fuel level fl3 is next to fuel level fl2, fuel level fl5 is next to fuel level fl4, person1 is at city4, person5 is at city2, plane1 is at city3, fuel level fl4 is next to fuel level fl3, person2 is at city3, person3 is at city4, fuel level fl2 is next to fuel level fl1, person4 is at city2, person6 is at city0, plane1 has fuel level fl1 and fuel level fl6 is next to fuel level fl5\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: plane1 flies from city3 to city2 with fuel level fl1 to fl0 to reach the current state.

In fact, fuel level fl6 is next to fuel level fl5, which is not next to fuel level fl1.\n* Person7 is not in plane1. They are actually in plane2.\n* Plane1 does not have fuel level fl6. It has fuel level fl0.\n* Person1 is not at city2. They are actually at city1.\n\nTherefore, the statement is False."}

Debarking a person in the city causes the person to be present in the city and not present in the aircraft. Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level.

is executable if the person and the aircraft are both present in the city. Boarding a person in the city causes the person to be in the aircraft and not present in the city. Debarking a person in a city is executable if the person is in the aircraft and the aircraft is present in the city. Debarking a person in the city causes the person to be present in the city and not present in the aircraft. Flying an aircraft from a city to another city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has an initial fuel level that is next to (i.e., higher than) some fuel level. Flying the aircraft from a city to a destination city causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft to the next level. Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city and not present in the original city. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down.

However, I must inform you that the initial condition you provided is not coherent and does not make sense. The fuel levels and the locations of the people and the plane are not consistent with each other.\n\nIn particular, fuel level fl0 is next to fuel level fl1, but person5 is at city1, which means they should have a higher fuel level than fuel level fl0. Similarly, fuel level fl4 is next to fuel level fl3, but person7 is at city0, which means they should have a lower fuel level than fuel level fl4.\n\nAdditionally, the location of the plane is not consistent with the fuel levels. The plane is supposed to be at city1, but the fuel level of the plane is fl0, which is lower than the fuel level of the plane.\n\nTherefore, I cannot answer your question as the initial condition is not valid. Please provide a coherent and consistent initial condition, and I will be happy to help you with your question."}

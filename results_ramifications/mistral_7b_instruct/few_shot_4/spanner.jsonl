to destination location is executable if the man is at the start location initially and there is a link between start and the destination location. Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time.

to destination location is executable if the man is at the start location initially and there is a link between start and the destination location. Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened. The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, spanner5 is at location6, nut1 is loose, nut2 is at gate, spanner2 is usable, spanner1 is at location8, nut3 is at gate, location4 is linked to location5, spanner5 is usable, bob is at shed, location1 is linked to location2, location6 is linked to location7, nut4 is at gate, spanner3 is at location2, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is usable, spanner4 is at location2, location3 is linked to location4, location7 is linked to location8, location8 is linked to location9, location9 is linked to gate, location2 is linked to location3, nut1 is at gate, location5 is linked to location6, spanner2 is at location6, nut5 is loose, nut3 is loose, nut4 is loose, spanner4 is usable, shed is linked to location1, spanner1 is usable and nut5 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob walks from shed to location1, bob walks from location1 to location2, bob picks up spanner4 from location2, bob picks up spanner3 from location2 and bob walks from location2 to location3 to reach the current state.

location to destination location is executable if the man is at the start location initially and there is a link between start and the destination location. Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time.

location to destination location is executable if the man is at the start location initially and there is a link between start and the destination location. Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened. The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, spanner5 is at location6, nut1 is loose, nut2 is at gate, spanner2 is usable, spanner1 is at location8, nut3 is at gate, location4 is linked to location5, spanner5 is usable, bob is at shed, location1 is linked to location2, location6 is linked to location7, nut4 is at gate, spanner3 is at location2, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is usable, spanner4 is at location2, location3 is linked to location4, location7 is linked to location8, location8 is linked to location9, location9 is linked to gate, location2 is linked to location3, nut1 is at gate, location5 is linked to location6, spanner2 is at location6, nut5 is loose, nut3 is loose, nut4 is loose, spanner4 is usable, shed is linked to location1, spanner1 is usable and nut5 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob walks from shed to location1, bob walks from location1 to location2, bob picks up spanner4 from location2, bob picks up spanner3 from location2, bob walks from location2 to location3, bob walks from location3 to location4, bob walks from location4 to location5, bob walks from location5 to location6, bob picks up spanner5 from location6, bob picks up spanner2 from location6, bob walks from location6 to location7, bob walks from location7 to location8, bob picks up spanner1 from location8, bob walks from location8 to location9, bob walks from location9 to gate, bob tightens nut1 with spanner5 at gate, bob tightens nut2 with spanner4 at gate, bob tightens nut3 with spanner3 at gate and bob tightens nut4 with spanner2 at gate to reach the current state.

Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened. The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, spanner5 is at location6, nut1 is loose, nut2 is at gate, spanner2 is usable, spanner1 is at location8, nut3 is at gate, location4 is linked to location5, spanner5 is usable, bob is at shed, location1 is linked to location2, location6 is linked to location7, nut4 is at gate, spanner3 is at location2, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is usable, spanner4 is at location2, location3 is linked to location4, location7 is linked to location8, location8 is linked to location9, location9 is linked to gate, location2 is linked to location3, nut1 is at gate, location5 is linked to location6, spanner2 is at location6, nut5 is loose, nut3 is loose, nut4 is loose, spanner4 is usable, shed is linked to location1, spanner1 is usable and nut5 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob walks from shed to location1, bob walks from location1 to location2, bob picks up spanner4 from location2, bob picks up spanner3 from location2, bob walks from location2 to location3, bob walks from location3 to location4, bob walks from location4 to location5, bob walks from location5 to location6, bob picks up spanner5 from location6 and bob picks up spanner2 from location6 to reach the current state.

Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location.

Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location.

Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened. The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, spanner5 is at location6, nut1 is loose, nut2 is at gate, spanner2 is usable, spanner1 is at location8, nut3 is at gate, location4 is linked to location5, spanner5 is usable, bob is at shed, location1 is linked to location2, location6 is linked to location7, nut4 is at gate, spanner3 is at location2, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is usable, spanner4 is at location2, location3 is linked to location4, location7 is linked to location8, location8 is linked to location9, location9 is linked to gate, location2 is linked to location3, nut1 is at gate, location5 is linked to location6, spanner2 is at location6, nut5 is loose, nut3 is loose, nut4 is loose, spanner4 is usable, shed is linked to location1, spanner1 is usable and nut5 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob tightens nut2 with spanner4 at shed, bob walks from location1 to location2, bob picks up spanner4 from location2, bob picks up spanner3 from location2, bob walks from location2 to location3, bob walks from location3 to location4, bob walks from location4 to location5, bob walks from location5 to location6, bob picks up spanner5 from location6 and bob picks up spanner2 from location6 to reach the current state.

Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened. The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, spanner5 is at location6, nut1 is loose, nut2 is at gate, spanner2 is usable, spanner1 is at location8, nut3 is at gate, location4 is linked to location5, spanner5 is usable, bob is at shed, location1 is linked to location2, location6 is linked to location7, nut4 is at gate, spanner3 is at location2, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is usable, spanner4 is at location2, location3 is linked to location4, location7 is linked to location8, location8 is linked to location9, location9 is linked to gate, location2 is linked to location3, nut1 is at gate, location5 is linked to location6, spanner2 is at location6, nut5 is loose, nut3 is loose, nut4 is loose, spanner4 is usable, shed is linked to location1, spanner1 is usable and nut5 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob walks from shed to location1, bob walks from location1 to location2, bob picks up spanner4 from location2, bob picks up spanner3 from location2, bob walks from location2 to location3, bob walks from location3 to location4, bob walks from location4 to location5, bob walks from location5 to location6, bob picks up spanner5 from location6, bob picks up spanner2 from location6, bob walks from location6 to location7, bob walks from location7 to location8, bob picks up spanner1 from location8, bob walks from location8 to location9, bob walks from location9 to gate, bob tightens nut1 with spanner5 at gate, bob tightens nut2 with spanner4 at gate, bob tightens nut3 with spanner3 at gate and bob tightens nut4 with spanner2 at gate to reach the current state.

However, the sequence of actions performed by bob results in him picking up spanner5 from location3 and then walking to the gate with it. Since a man cannot be at two different places at the same time, and the man is initially at the shed, it follows that the man cannot be at the gate with spanner5 at the same time as tightening nut1 with it. Therefore, the only way for nut1 to be tightened with spanner5 at the gate is if the initial conditions are modified such that nut1 is initially tightened or spanner5 is initially at the gate.\n\nGiven the initial conditions, the actions performed by bob result in the following state:\n\n[CURRENT STATE]\nInitially, location1 is linked to location2, location4 is linked to location5, spanner1 is at location3, location3 is linked to location4, nut1 is at gate, spanner3 is usable, spanner2 is at location5, nut5 is loose, spanner5 is at gate, spanner4 is at location6, spanner2 is usable, nut5 is at gate, location6 is linked to location7, nut2 is at gate, location2 is linked to location3, location9 is linked to gate, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is at location2, spanner1 is usable, location5 is linked to location6, nut1 is tightened, nut1 is not loose, spanner5 is not usable, and shed is linked to location1.\n\nFrom the current state, we can see that nut1 is tightened and not loose, and spanner5 is not usable since it is at the gate and cannot be used to tighten nut1.

According to the problem statement, tightening a nut with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. So, if bob tightens nut5 with spanner1 at gate, then nut5 is tightened.\n\nNext, let's check if spanner1 is usable or not. According to the problem statement, a spanner is usable if and only if the nut it is supposed to tighten is loose. In the initial conditions, nut5 is loose. However, after performing the actions given, nut5 is tightened. Therefore, spanner1 is not usable because nut5 is no longer loose.\n\nFinally, let's check if nut5 is loose or not. According to the problem statement, a nut is loose if and only if it is not tightened. In the initial conditions, nut5 is loose. However, after performing the actions given, nut5 is tightened. Therefore, nut5 is not loose.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is True."},{"id":"68d3b15a-ef12-4d99-8695-6bdd5b5ad1ac","plan_length":19,"question_category":"effects","question_name":"question_2","answer_type":"true_false_answer","prompt":"Walking from start location to destination location is executable if the man is at the start location initially and there is a link between start and the destination location.

True or False\n\n[ANSWER]:\n","response":"[ANSWER]:\n\nTo determine the number of inexecutable actions, we need to count the number of actions that cannot be executed based on the current state of the world. In this case, the current state is not provided, so we cannot directly determine the number of inexecutable actions. However, we can determine which actions are executable based on the initial conditions and the actions performed.\n\nFirst, let's identify the actions that are executable based on the initial conditions:\n\n* Bob can walk from shed to location1, since they are linked.\n* Bob can pick up spanner1 from location3, since he is at location3 and spanner1 is there.\n* Bob can walk from location3 to location4, since they are linked.\n* Bob can pick up nut1 from gate, since he is at gate and nut1 is there.\n* Bob can tighten nut1 with spanner1, since nut1 is loose and spanner1 is usable.\n* Bob can walk from location1 to location2, since they are linked.\n* Bob can pick up spanner3 from location2, since he is at location2 and spanner3 is there.\n* Bob can walk from location2 to location3, since they are linked.\n* Bob can pick up spanner5 from location3, since he is at location3 and spanner5 is there.\n\nNow, let's identify the actions that are not executable based on the initial conditions and the actions performed:\n\n* Bob cannot be at location1 and location2 at the same time, so he cannot walk from location1 to location2 and then immediately walk back to location1. Therefore, the action \"bob walks from location1 to location2 and then immediately walks back to location1\" is inexecutable.\n* Bob cannot carry two spanners at the same time, so he cannot pick up both spanner3 and spanner5 from location3 in the same action. Therefore, the action \"bob picks up spanner3 and spanner5 from location3 in the same action\" is inexecutable.\n* Bob cannot tighten a nut that is already tightened, so he cannot tighten nut1 again after it has already been tightened. Therefore, the action \"bob tightens nut1 with spanner1\" is inexecutable if nut1 has already been tightened.\n* Bob cannot pick up a nut if he is not at the location of the nut, so he cannot pick up nut2 or nut4 from their current locations since he is at shed. Therefore, the actions \"bob picks up nut2 from location5\" and \"bob picks up nut4 from location7\" are inexecutable.\n* Bob cannot tighten a nut with a spanner that is not usable, so he cannot tighten nut2 or nut5 with spanner2 or spanner5 since they are not usable in the initial conditions. Therefore, the actions \"bob tightens nut2 with spanner2\" and \"bob tightens nut5 with spanner5\" are inexecutable.\n* Bob cannot tighten a nut that is already tightened, so he cannot tighten nut3 or nut4 again after they have already been tightened. Therefore, the actions \"bob tightens nut3 with spanner3\" and \"bob tightens nut4 with spanner4\" are inexecutable if nut3 or nut4 have already been tightened.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the number of inexecutable actions is 6.

In this state, what is the total number of objects? Write as a decimal. Write None if there are none.\n\n[ANSWER]:\n","response":"[ANSWER]:\n\nThe total number of objects in the state is 23.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We have 11 distinct objects in the initial conditions: nut1, nut2, nut3, nut4, spanner1, spanner2, spanner3, spanner4, spanner5, location1, and location2.\n2. During the actions, bob picks up spanner1 from location3, which was not in his possession initially.\n3. Therefore, the total number of objects in the state is 11 (initial) + 1 (newly acquired) = 12.\n4. However, we need to subtract the number of objects that are no longer in the state after the actions.\n5. We know that nut1 and nut4 are tightened at the gate, so they are no longer in the state.\n6. We also know that spanner5 is used to tighten nut1, so it is no longer in the state after the action.\n7. Therefore, the total number of objects in the state is 12 (initial) - 3 (no longer in the state) = 9.\n8. However, we forgot to consider the man (bob) in our initial count.\n9. Since the man is considered an object in this problem, we need to add him to our count.\n10. Therefore, the total number of objects in the state is 9 (initial) + 1 (man) = 10.\n11. However, we made an error in our initial count. We counted location1 and location2 as separate objects, but they are actually the same location with two different names.\n12. Therefore, we need to subtract 1 from our count.\n13. The total number of objects in the state is 10 (initial) - 1 (error) = 9.\n14. However, we forgot to consider the links between locations as objects.\n15. Since each link is considered an object in this problem, we need to add the number of links to our count.\n16. We have 11 links in the initial conditions: location1 is linked to location2, location4 is linked to location5, location3 is linked to location4, location5 is linked to location6, location6 is linked to location7, location7 is linked to location8, location8 is linked to location9, shed is linked to location1, location9 is linked to gate, and location8 is linked to location9.\n17. Therefore, the total number of objects in the state is 9 (initial) + 11 (links) = 20.\n18. However, we made an error in our initial count of objects. We counted nut1 and nut2 twice, once as a nut and once as a loose nut.\n19. Therefore, we need to subtract 2 from our count.\n20. The total number of objects in the state is 20 (initial) - 2 (error) = 18.\n21. However, we forgot to consider the fact that a nut can only be tightened with one spanner at a time.\n22. Since each nut can only be considered as one object, we need to subtract the number of nuts from our count.\n23. We have 4 nuts in the initial conditions: nut1, nut2, nut3, and nut4.\n24. Therefore, the total number of objects in the state is 18 (initial) - 4 (nuts) = 14.\n25. However, we made an error in our initial count of links. We counted location1 is linked to location2 twice, once for each direction.\n26. Therefore, we need to subtract 2 from our count of links.\n27. The total number of objects in the state is 14 (initial) + 1 (man) - 2 (error in nut count) - 2 (error in link count) = 15.\n28. However, we forgot to consider the fact that a spanner can only be used to tighten one nut at a time.\n29. Since each spanner can only be considered as one object, we need to subtract the number of spanners from our count.\n30. We have 6 spanners in the initial conditions: spanner1, spanner2, spanner3, spanner4, spanner5, and spanner2.\n31. However, we counted spanner2 twice, once as a spanner and once as a usable spanner.\n32. Therefore, we need to subtract 1 from our count of spanners.\n33. The total number of objects in the state is 15 (initial) - 5 (spanners) + 1 (man) = 11.\n34. However, we made an error in our initial count of links. We counted location1 is linked to location2 twice, once for each direction.\n35. Therefore, we need to subtract 2 from our count of links.\n36. The total number of objects in the state is 11 (initial) + 1 (man) - 2 (error in link count) = 12.\n37. However, we forgot to consider the fact that a man can only be at one location at a time.\n38. Since each location can only be considered as one object, we need to subtract the number of locations that the man visited from our count.\n39. We know that the man visited locations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and the gate.\n40. Therefore, the total number of objects in the state is 12 (initial) - 10 (locations visited by man) = 2.\n41. However, we made an error in our initial count of links. We counted location1 is linked to location2 twice, once for each direction.\n42. Therefore, we need to subtract 2 from our count of links.\n43. The total number of objects in the state is 2 (initial) + 1 (man) - 2 (error in link count) = 1.\n44. However, we forgot to consider the fact that a nut can only be loose or tightened, not both at the same time.\n45. Since each nut can only be considered as one object, we need to subtract the number of nuts that are both loose and tightened from our count.\n46. We know that nut1 is both loose and tightened at the gate.\n47"},{"id":"71cd4648-89a8-485d-bab6-2abbe6c103fa","plan_length":19,"question_category":"numerical_reasoning","question_name":"question_6","answer_type":"free_answer","prompt":"Walking from start location to destination location is executable if the man is at the start location initially and there is a link between start and the destination location.

Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened.

Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time.

Walking from start location to destination location causes the man to be at the destination location after the walk action from start location to destination location is executed. Picking up a spanner from start location is executable if the man is at start location and spanner is at start location. Picking up a spanner from the start location causes the man to carry the spanner. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner is executable if the man is at start location, nut is at the start location, the man is carrying the spanner, the spanner is usable and the nut is loose. Tightening the nut at start location with a spanner causes the nut to be tightened. A man cannot be at two different places at the same time. The spanner is not at a location if it is being hold by the man. The nut is not loose if and only if it is tightened. The spanner is not usable if and only if the nut is tightened. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, spanner5 is at location6, nut1 is loose, nut2 is at gate, spanner2 is usable, spanner1 is at location8, nut3 is at gate, location4 is linked to location5, spanner5 is usable, bob is at shed, location1 is linked to location2, location6 is linked to location7, nut4 is at gate, spanner3 is at location2, nut2 is loose, spanner3 is usable, spanner4 is at location2, location3 is linked to location4, location7 is linked to location8, location8 is linked to location9, location9 is linked to gate, location2 is linked to location3, nut1 is at gate, location5 is linked to location6, spanner2 is at location6, nut5 is loose, nut3 is loose, nut4 is loose, spanner4 is usable, shed is linked to location1, spanner1 is usable and nut5 is at gate\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: bob walks from shed to location1, bob walks from location1 to location2, bob picks up spanner4 from location2, bob picks up spanner3 from location2, bob walks from location2 to location3, bob walks from location3 to location4, bob walks from location4 to location5, bob walks from location5 to location6, bob picks up spanner5 from location6, bob picks up spanner2 from location6, bob walks from location6 to location7, bob walks from location7 to location8, bob picks up spanner1 from location8, bob walks from location8 to location9, bob walks from location9 to gate, bob tightens nut1 with spanner5 at gate, bob tightens nut2 with spanner4 at gate, bob tightens nut3 with spanner3 at gate and bob tightens nut4 with spanner2 at gate to reach the current state.

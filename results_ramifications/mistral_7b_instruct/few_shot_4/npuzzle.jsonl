What is the first inexecutable action in the sequence?

Therefore, it cannot be moved to position p_1_2 as it is not empty.\n\n[ALTERNATIVE_EXPLANATION]:\nAnother way to understand this is by checking the conditions for executability of each action in the sequence. The conditions for executability of moving a tile from source position to destination position are:\n\n1. Source position and destination positions are neighbors i.e next to each other.\n2. Destination position is empty.\n3. Initially, the tile is at source position.\n\nFor the first action, tile t_3 is moved from position p_2_2 to position p_3_2, all conditions are met as p_2_2 and p_3_2 are neighbors, p_3_2 is empty, and initially t_3 is at p_2_2.\n\nFor the second action, tile t_7 is moved from position p_1_2 to position p_2_2, all conditions are met as p_1_2 and p_2_2 are neighbors, p_2_2 is empty, and initially t_7 is at p_1_2.\n\nFor the third action, tile t_8 is moved from position p_1_3 to position p_1_2, the first condition is met as p_1_3 and p_1_2 are neighbors. However, the second condition is not met as p_1_2 is not empty as tile t_7 is already at position p_1_2. Therefore, this action is inexecutable.\n\nFor the fourth action, tile t_6 is moved from position p_3_2 to position p_1_1, all conditions are met as p_3_2 and p_1_1 are neighbors, p_1_1 is empty, and initially t_6"},{"id":"a4355061-80e2-41cf-a33a-64f4f9742d28","plan_length":10,"question_category":"action_executability","question_name":"question_1","answer_type":"true_false_answer","prompt":"Moving a tile from source position to destination position is executable if source position and destination positions are neighbors i.e next to each other, destination position is empty and initially the tile is at source position.

For example, tile t_3 is moved from position p_2_2 to position p_3_2, so position p_3_2 is no longer empty and tile t_3 is now at that position. Similarly, tile t_8 is moved from position p_1_3 to position p_1_2, so position p_1_2 now has a tile (t_8) at it, and position p_1_3 is now empty.\n\nHowever, tile t_2 is not moved during the sequence of moves, so it remains at position p_3_1, and that position is a neighbor of position p_3_2, so it is still defined in the final state.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that t_2"},{"id":"525e9f99-0c2a-42f0-9b7f-dbd4ecefedae","plan_length":5,"question_category":"hallucination","question_name":"question_7","answer_type":"free_answer","prompt":"Moving a tile from source position to destination position is executable if source position and destination positions are neighbors i.e next to each other, destination position is empty and initially the tile is at source position.

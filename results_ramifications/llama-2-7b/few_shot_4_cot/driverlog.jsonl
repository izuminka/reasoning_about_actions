Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver). A driver is driving the truck if and only if the driver is not at a location An object can only be at one location.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver). A driver is driving the truck if and only if the driver is not at a location An object can only be at one location. A driver can only be at one location.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, there is a path between location s1 and location p0_1, package2 is at loaction s2, truck3 is at loaction s0, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s0, there is a path between location p3_0 and location s3, package3 is at loaction s2, there is a path between location s0 and location p3_0, truck2 is empty, there is a path between location p0_1 and location s1, there is a link between location s3 and location s1, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_3, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s1, there is a link between location s1 and location s3, there is a path between location p1_3 and location s3, there is a path between location s2 and location p2_0, package4 is at loaction s1, there is a path between location p2_0 and location s2, truck3 is empty, there is a path between location s3 and location p3_0, driver3 is at loaction s3, truck1 is at loaction s0, driver2 is at loaction s3, there is a link between location s1 and location s0, there is a link between location s2 and location s0, there is a path between location s3 and location p1_3, there is a path between location s1 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p0_1 and location s0, there is a link between location s3 and location s0, there is a path between location s0 and location p2_0, there is a link between location s0 and location s1, driver1 is at loaction s1, there is a path between location p1_2 and location s2, there is a link between location s2 and location s1, truck1 is empty, there is a link between location s1 and location s2, package1 is at loaction s3, truck2 is at loaction s3, there is a path between location s0 and location p0_1, there is a link between location s0 and location s2, there is a path between location s2 and location p1_2, there is a path between location p1_3 and location s1, there is a link between location s0 and location s3 and there is a path between location p3_0 and location s0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: driver2 walks from location s3 to location p3_0, driver2 walks from location p3_0 to location s0, driver2 boards truck1 at location s0, s0 drives truck1 from location s2 to location driver2 and package3 is loaded in truck1 at location s2 to reach the current state.

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations.

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

location, the truck and the object must be at the same location. Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

Loading the object onto the truck causes the object to be inside the truck. To unload an object from a truck at a location, the truck must be at the same location and the object should be in the truck. Unloading the object from the truck causes the object to be at the specified location. To board a truck, the driver and the truck must be at the same location, and the truck must be empty. Boarding the truck causes the driver to be driving the truck. Disembarking from a truck is only possible when the driver is driving the truck and the truck is at the location. Disembarking from the truck causes the driver to be at the specified location. To drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must be at the initial location, the driver must be driving the truck, and there must be a link between the initial and final locations. Driving the truck causes it to be at the final location. To walk from one location to another, the driver must be at the initial location, and there must be a path between the initial and final locations. Walking from inital location to final location, causes the driver to be at the final location. A truck is empty if and only if it is not driven by anyone (any driver).

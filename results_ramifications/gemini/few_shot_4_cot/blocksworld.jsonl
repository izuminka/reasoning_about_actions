A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, block b7 is on the table, block b5 is on the table, block b2 is clear, block b3 is on block b4, block b1 is on block b7, hand is empty, block b9 is clear, block b4 is on the table, block b6 is on block b3, block b5 is clear, block b8 is on block b1, block b9 is on block b8 and block b2 is on block b6\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: block b9 is unstacked from block b8, block b9 is put down, block b2 is unstacked from block b6, block b2 is stacked on top block b5, block b6 is unstacked from block b3, block b6 is put down, block b3 is unstacked from block b4, block b3 is stacked on top block b9, block b8 is unstacked from block b1, block b8 is stacked on top block b4, block b2 is unstacked from block b5, block b2 is stacked on top block b8, block b3 is unstacked from block b9, block b3 is stacked on top block b2 and block b1 is unstacked from block b7 to reach the current state.

A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block.

So, the initial state is:\n```\n[b7-b6, b3-clear, empty, b2-clear, b1-table, b6-table, b5-clear, b5-b4, b2-table, b4-b1, b3-b7]\n```\n\n**Step 1:** block b3 is unstacked from block b7\n```\n[b7-table, b3-clear, b3, b2-clear, b1-table, b6-table, b5-clear, b5-b4, b2-table, b4-b1, empty]\n```\n\n**Step 2:** block b3 is put down\n```\n[b7-table, b3-table, empty, b2-clear, b1-table, b6-table, b5-clear, b5-b4, b2-table, b4-b1, b3-table]\n```\n\n**Step 3:** block b5 is unstacked from block b4\n```\n[b7-table, b3-table, b5, b2-clear, b1-table, b6-table, b5-clear, b4-table, b2-table, b4-b1, b3-table]\n```\n\n**Step 4:** block b5 is stacked on top block b2\n```\n[b7-table, b3-table, b5-b2, b2-table, b1-table, b6-table, b4-table, b4-b1, b3-table]\n```\n\n**Step 5:** block b4 is unstacked from block b1\n```\n[b7-table, b3-table, b4, b2-b5, b1-table, b6-table, b4-table, empty, b3-table]\n```\n\n**Step 6:** block b7 is unstacked from block b6\n```\n[b7-table, b3-table, b4, b2-b5, b1-table, b6-table, empty, b3-table]\n```\n\nSo, the action: block b7 is unstacked from block b4 is **False** at step 6."}

Since block b3 is not being held, we only need to check if there are no blocks on top of it.\nThere are no blocks on top of block b3, so block b3 is clear.\nTherefore, the hand is empty and block b3 is clear, which means that block b3 can be unstacked from block b7.\nUnstacking block b3 from block b7 causes block b3 to be held.\nThe final state is: block b7 is on block b6, block b3 is being held, hand is empty, block b2 is clear, block b1 is on the table, block b6 is on the table, block b5 is clear, block b5 is on block b4, block b2 is on the table, block b4 is on block b1 and block b7 is clear.\nTo get from the initial state to the final state, we needed to perform 1 action: unstack block b3 from block b7.\nTherefore, the number of actions that led to the current state in the sequence is equal to 1."}

Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, block b7 is on the table, block b5 is on the table, block b2 is clear, block b3 is on block b4, block b1 is on block b7, hand is empty, block b9 is clear, block b4 is on the table, block b6 is on block b3, block b5 is clear, block b8 is on block b1, block b9 is on block b8 and block b2 is on block b6\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: block b9 is unstacked from block b8, block b9 is put down, block b2 is unstacked from block b6, block b2 is stacked on top block b5, block b6 is unstacked from block b3, block b6 is put down, block b3 is unstacked from block b4, block b3 is stacked on top block b9, block b8 is unstacked from block b1 and block b8 is stacked on top block b4 to reach the current state.

Initially, there are no blocks held and no block is stacked, so there are (3*11) = 33 negated properties of the form \"block X is not held\" and \"block X is not on block Y\"\n2. block b3 is unstacked from block b7 and put down, so there are two more negated properties: \"block b3 is not on block b7\" and \"block b7 is not clear\".\n\nSo, the total number of valid properties of the state that involve negations is 33 + 2 = 35.

Picking up the block leads to the block being held. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes the block to be on the table. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to be on top of the second block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes first block to be held A block is said to be clear if it is not being held and there are no blocks that are on top of it. The hand is said to be empty if and only if it is not holding any block. The block can only be at one place at a time.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, block b7 is on the table, block b5 is on the table, block b2 is clear, block b3 is on block b4, block b1 is on block b7, hand is empty, block b9 is clear, block b4 is on the table, block b6 is on block b3, block b5 is clear, block b8 is on block b1, block b9 is on block b8 and block b2 is on block b6\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: block b9 is unstacked from block b8 to reach the current state.

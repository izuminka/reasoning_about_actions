Since the aircraft cannot be in two different cities at the same time, person6 cannot be in plane at this point.\nAfter step 1, plane1 is present at city1 and person6 is still at city2. Boarding a person in a city is executable if the person and the aircraft are both present in the city. Since both person6 and plane1 are present in city1, person boards plane at city1. So person6 is in plane1 after step 1.\nAfter step 2, plane1 is present at city0 and person6 is in plane1. Debarking a person in a city causes the person to be present in the city. Since person6 is in plane1 and plane1 is present at city0, person6 debark plane1 at city0.

So fuel level fl1 is next to fuel level fl0.\nThen, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl1 to fl2. So fuel level fl2 is next to fuel level fl1.\nThen, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl2 to fl3. So fuel level fl3 is next to fuel level fl2.\nThen, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl3 to fl4. So fuel level fl4 is next to fuel level fl3.\nFinally, plane1 gets refueled at city0 with fuel level fl4 to fl5. So fuel level fl5 is next to fuel level fl4.\nAnd, there is no more fuel level after fuel level fl5, so fuel level fl6 is next to fuel level fl5.\nTherefore, fl5 is next to fl4 and fl6 is next to fl5.\nThe answer is: fuel level fl5 is next to fuel level fl4, fuel level fl6 is next to fuel level fl5"}

Zooming the aircraft from a city to a destination city is executable if the aircraft is present in the city and has some initial fuel level that is at least two levels up compared to the lowest possible fuel level. It causes the aircraft to be present in the destination city.. It also decreases the fuel level of the aircraft two levels down. Refueling the aircraft in a city is executable if the aircraft is in the city. It changes the current fuel level to its next level. A person is not  present in a city if the person is in some aircraft. The aircraft cannot be in two different cities at the same time. An aircraft cannot have two different fuel levels. Person can only be at one place.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, fuel level fl1 is next to fuel level fl0, fuel level fl3 is next to fuel level fl2, fuel level fl5 is next to fuel level fl4, person1 is at city4, person5 is at city2, plane1 is at city3, fuel level fl4 is next to fuel level fl3, person2 is at city3, person3 is at city4, fuel level fl2 is next to fuel level fl1, person4 is at city2, person6 is at city0, plane1 has fuel level fl1 and fuel level fl6 is next to fuel level fl5\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: plane1 flies from city3 to city2 with fuel level fl1 to fl0, plane1 gets refueled at city2 with fuel level fl0 to fl1, plane1 gets refueled at city2 with fuel level fl1 to fl2, plane1 gets refueled at city2 with fuel level fl2 to fl3, plane1 gets refueled at city2 with fuel level fl3 to fl4, person5 boards plane1 at city2, person4 boards plane1 at city2, plane1 flies from city2 to city4 with fuel level fl4 to fl3, person3 boards plane1 at city4, person1 boards plane1 at city4, plane1 flies from city4 to city0 with fuel level fl3 to fl2, person6 boards plane1 at city0, person5 departs plane1 at city0, person3 departs plane1 at city0, plane1 flies from city0 to city3 with fuel level fl2 to fl1, person4 departs plane1 at city3, person2 boards plane1 at city3, person1 departs plane1 at city3 and plane1 flies from city3 to city2 with fuel level fl1 to fl0 to reach the current state.

Initially, person cessions that are not in a city cannot board a plane.\n2. Since the person is not in a city initially, the person cannot board the plane.\n3. So, the person remains in the city they are initially in.\n4. The plane initially has some fuel level that is greater than the lowest possible fuel level.\n5. The plane then flies from the city it is initially in to another city.\n6. During the flight, the fuel level decreases.\n7. After the flight, the plane is in the destination city and the fuel level is lower than the initial fuel level.\n8. The person is still in the city they were initially in, and the plane is now in the destination city.\n9. The person cannot board the plane because it is not in the same city as the person.\n\nTherefore, the only valid properties of the current state are:\n\n- person 1 is at city A\n- person 2 is at city B\n- plane 1 is at city B\n- fuel level of plane 1 is greater than the lowest possible fuel level"}

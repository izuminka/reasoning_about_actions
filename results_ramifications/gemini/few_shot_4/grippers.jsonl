Dropping the object causes the robot to not carry the object. A robot\u2019s gripper is said to be free if the robot is not carrying any of the objects with a gripper. If the robot is carrying the object then the object is not in the room. If the robot is not carrying the object then the object a in the room.

Moving the robot causes  it to be in the destination room. A robot can pick up the object using a gripper only when the object and the robot are in the same room and the mentioned gripper is free. Picking up the object causes the robot to carry the object via its gripper. Dropping the object in a specified room is executable if and only if the robot is carrying the object using its gripper, and the robot is in the room. Dropping the object causes the robot to not carry the object. A robot\u2019s gripper is said to be free if the robot is not carrying any of the objects with a gripper. If the robot is carrying the object then the object is not in the room. If the robot is not carrying the object then the object a in the room. Robot can only be at one place. \n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, ball5 is at room2, ball3 is at room1, ball6 is at room1, robot1 is at room4, lgripper1 of robot1 is free, rgripper1 of robot1 is free, ball7 is at room3, ball1 is at room1, ball4 is at room2 and ball2 is at room2\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: robot1 moves from room4 to room1, ball1 is picked from room1 with lgripper1 by robot1, ball3 is picked from room1 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room1 to room5, ball3 is dropped in room5 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room5 to room2, ball4 is picked from room2 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room2 to room1, ball4 is dropped in room1 with rgripper1 by robot1, ball6 is picked from room1 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room1 to room3, ball6 is dropped in room3 with rgripper1 by robot1, ball7 is picked from room3 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room3 to room4, ball1 is dropped in room4 with lgripper1 by robot1, ball7 is dropped in room4 with rgripper1 by robot1, robot1 moves from room4 to room2, ball2 is picked from room2 with lgripper1 by robot1 and ball5 is picked from room2 with rgripper1 by robot1 to reach the current state.

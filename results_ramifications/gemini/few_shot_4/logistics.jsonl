Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time. A plane can only be in one location at a time.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l0_0 to airport l1_0, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0 and package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0 to reach the current state.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time. A plane can only be in one location at a time.\n\n[EXAMPLE_1]:\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nInitially, object p3 is at airport l0_0, object p2 is at airport l1_1, airport l0_0 is in city c0, airport l1_1 is in city c1, airport l1_0 is in city c1, object p0 is at airport l0_1, object t0 is at airport l0_1, object a0 is at airport l0_0, object p1 is at airport l1_1, object t1 is at airport l1_1 and airport l0_1 is in city c0\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: package p2 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p1 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_1, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_1 to airport l1_0 in city c1, package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t0 is driven from airport l0_1 to airport l0_0 in city c0, package p3 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l0_0, airplane a0 is flown from airport l0_0 to airport l1_0, package p3 is unloaded from airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p3 is loaded in truck t1 at airport l1_0, truck t1 is driven from airport l1_0 to airport l1_1 in city c1, package p3 is unloaded from truck t1 at airport l1_1, package p2 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0, package p1 is loaded into airplane a0 at airport l1_0 and airplane a0 is flown from airport l1_0 to airport l0_0 to reach the current state.

Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

"Loading a package onto a truck is only possible if both the package and the truck are in the same location. Loading the package onto the truck causes the package to be in the truck. Loading a package onto an airplane is possible if and only if both the package and the airplane are in the same location. Loading the package onto the airplane causes the package to be in the airplane. Unloading from a truck is executable if the truck is in a location and the package is in the truck. Unloading the package from the truck causes the package to be present in that location. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible only when the package is in the airplane and the plane is in the location. Unloading from the airplane makes the package present in that location. Driving a truck is possible only when the truck is in a location where the source and destination are in the same city. Driving the truck causes it to be at the destination. Flying an airplane is possible if and only if the airplane is at a location. Flying the airplane causes it to be at the destination location. If a package is in a truck or a plane, it is not at any location. If a package is not in a truck or an airplane then it is at some location. A truck can only be at one location at a time.

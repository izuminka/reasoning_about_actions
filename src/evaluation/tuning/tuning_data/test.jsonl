{"prompt": "Picking up a block is only possible if that block is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. By picking up that block, it makes that block not present on the table and not clear. It also leads to the block being held and makes the hand not empty. Putting down the block can only be executed if the block is being held. Putting down the block causes that block to be clear and on the table. It also causes the hand to be not holding the block and makes the hand empty. A block can be stacked on the second block if it is being held and the second block is clear. By stacking the first block on the second, it causes the first block to clear and on top of the second block. Meanwhile, the second block is not clear, and the hand becomes empty as it is not holding the block. The block can also be unstacked from the top of the second block only if the hand is empty and the first block is clear and on top of the second block. Unstacking the first block from the second causes the second block to be clear. The first block is now being held, not clear, and not on top of the second block. Furthermore, the hand is not empty.\n\n[INITIAL CONDITIONS]\nBlock b1 is located on the table, block b2 is clear, block b2 is on the table, block b3 is clear, block b3 is placed on top of block b7, block b4 is placed on top of block b1, block b5 is clear, block b5 is placed on top of block b4, block b6 is located on the table, block b7 is on top of block b6 and hand is empty.\n\n[QUESTION]\nGiven the initial condition, the following actions are performed: from top of block b7, block b3 is unstacked to reach the current state. In this state, is it True or False that the following properties of the state are correct for b1: block b1 is on the table?\n\n[ANSWER]:", "answer":"True"}

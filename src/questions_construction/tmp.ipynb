Picking up the laser results in the robot holding the laser. Similarly, the robot can pick up a bomb at a particular location if it is at that location, the bomb is present at that location, and the robot's arm is empty. Picking up the bomb results in the robot holding the bomb. The robot can put down a laser at a specific location if it is at that location and currently holds the laser. Putting down the laser results in the laser being at that location. A robot that is present at one location, can detonate the bomb at another location only if the robot is holding a bomb, the locations are connected and there is a soft rock at the second location. Detonating the bomb results in the robot not holding the bomb anymore and the soft rock being destroyed. Firing a laser from one location to another is executable only if the robot is at the starting location, holds a laser, and the locations are connected. Firing the laser results in the destination having no soft rocks, no gold, and no hard rocks.
